"""table_per_related.py

Illustrates a generic association which persists association
objects within individual tables, each one generated to persist
those objects on behalf of a particular parent class.

This configuration has the advantage that each type of parent
maintains its "Address" rows separately, so that collection
size for one type of parent will have no impact on other types
of parent.   Navigation between parent and "Address" is simple,
direct, and bidirectional.

This recipe is the most efficient (speed wise and storage wise)
and simple of all of them.

The creation of many related tables may seem at first like an issue
but there really isn't any - the management and targeting of these tables
is completely automated.
