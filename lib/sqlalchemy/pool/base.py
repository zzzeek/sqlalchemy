        Construct a Pool.

        :param creator: a callable function that returns a DB-API
          connection object.  The function will be called with
          parameters.

        :param recycle: If set to a value other than -1, number of 
          seconds between connection recycling, which means upon 
          checkout, if this timeout is surpassed the connection will be 
          closed and replaced with a newly opened connection. Defaults to -1.

        :param logging_name:  String identifier which will be used within
          the "name" field of logging records generated within the
          "sqlalchemy.pool" logger. Defaults to a hexstring of the object's
          id.

        :param echo: If True, connections being pulled and retrieved
          from the pool will be logged to the standard output, as well
          as pool sizing information.  Echoing can also be achieved by
          enabling logging for the "sqlalchemy.pool"
          namespace. Defaults to False.

        :param use_threadlocal: If set to True, repeated calls to
          :meth:`connect` within the same application thread will be
          guaranteed to return the same connection object, if one has
          already been retrieved from the pool and has not been
          returned yet.  Offers a slight performance advantage at the
          cost of individual transactions by default.  The
          :meth:`.Pool.unique_connection` method is provided to return
          a consistently unique connection to bypass this behavior
          when the flag is set.

          .. warning::  The :paramref:`.Pool.use_threadlocal` flag
             **does not affect the behavior** of :meth:`.Engine.connect`.
             :meth:`.Engine.connect` makes use of the
             :meth:`.Pool.unique_connection` method which **does not use thread
             local context**.  To produce a :class:`.Connection` which refers
             to the :meth:`.Pool.connect` method, use
             :meth:`.Engine.contextual_connect`.

             Note that other SQLAlchemy connectivity systems such as
             :meth:`.Engine.execute` as well as the orm
             :class:`.Session` make use of
             :meth:`.Engine.contextual_connect` internally, so these functions
             are compatible with the :paramref:`.Pool.use_threadlocal` setting.

          .. seealso::

            :ref:`threadlocal_strategy` - contains detail on the
            "threadlocal" engine strategy, which provides a more comprehensive
            approach to "threadlocal" connectivity for the specific
            use case of using :class:`.Engine` and :class:`.Connection` objects
            directly.

        :param reset_on_return: Determine steps to take on
          connections as they are returned to the pool.
          reset_on_return can have any of these values:

          * ``"rollback"`` - call rollback() on the connection,
            to release locks and transaction resources.
            This is the default value.  The vast majority
            of use cases should leave this value set.
          * ``True`` - same as 'rollback', this is here for
            backwards compatibility.
          * ``"commit"`` - call commit() on the connection,
            to release locks and transaction resources.
            A commit here may be desirable for databases that
            cache query plans if a commit is emitted,
            such as Microsoft SQL Server.  However, this
            value is more dangerous than 'rollback' because
            any data changes present on the transaction
            are committed unconditionally.
          * ``None`` - don't do anything on the connection.
            This setting should generally only be made on a database
            that has no transaction support at all,
            namely MySQL MyISAM; when used on this backend, performance
            can be improved as the "rollback" call is still expensive on
            MySQL.   It is **strongly recommended** that this setting not be
            used for transaction-supporting databases in conjunction with
            a persistent pool such as :class:`.QueuePool`, as it opens
            the possibility for connections still in a transaction to be
            idle in the pool.   The setting may be appropriate in the
            case of :class:`.NullPool` or special circumstances where
            the connection pool in use is not being used to maintain connection
            lifecycle.

          * ``False`` - same as None, this is here for
            backwards compatibility.

        :param events: a list of 2-tuples, each of the form
         ``(callable, target)`` which will be passed to :func:`.event.listen`
         upon construction.   Provided here so that event listeners
         can be assigned via :func:`.create_engine` before dialect-level
         listeners are applied.

        :param listeners: Deprecated.  A list of
          :class:`~sqlalchemy.interfaces.PoolListener`-like objects or
          dictionaries of callables that receive events when DB-API
          connections are created, checked out and checked in to the
          pool.  This has been superseded by
          :func:`~sqlalchemy.event.listen`.

        :param dialect: a :class:`.Dialect` that will handle the job
         of calling rollback(), close(), or commit() on DBAPI connections.
         If omitted, a built-in "stub" dialect is used.   Applications that
         make use of :func:`~.create_engine` should not use this parameter
         as it is handled by the engine creation strategy.

         .. versionadded:: 1.1 - ``dialect`` is now a public parameter
            to the :class:`.Pool`.

        :param pre_ping: if True, the pool will emit a "ping" (typically
         "SELECT 1", but is dialect-specific) on the connection
         upon checkout, to test if the connection is alive or not.   If not,
         the connection is transparently re-connected and upon success, all
         other pooled connections established prior to that timestamp are
         invalidated.     Requires that a dialect is passed as well to
         interpret the disconnection error.
