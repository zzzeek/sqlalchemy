Special Directives
------------------

``__declare_last__()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``__declare_last__()`` hook allows definition of
a class level function that is automatically called by the
:meth:`.MapperEvents.after_configured` event, which occurs after mappings are
assumed to be completed and the 'configure' step has finished:

.. sourcecode:: python

    class MyClass(Base):
        @classmethod
        def __declare_last__(cls):
            ""
            # do something with mappings

``__declare_first__()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like ``__declare_last__()``, but is called at the beginning of mapper
configuration via the :meth:`.MapperEvents.before_configured` event:

.. sourcecode:: python

    class MyClass(Base):
        @classmethod
        def __declare_first__(cls):
            ""
            # do something before mappings are configured

.. versionadded:: 0.9.3

.. _declarative_abstract:

``__abstract__``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``__abstract__`` causes declarative to skip the production
of a table or mapper for the class entirely.  A class can be added within a
hierarchy in the same way as mixin (see :ref:`declarative_mixins`), allowing
subclasses to extend just from the special class:

.. sourcecode:: python

    class SomeAbstractBase(Base):
        __abstract__ = True

        def some_helpful_method(self):
            ""

        @declared_attr
        def __mapper_args__(cls):
            return {"helpful mapper arguments":True}

    class MyMappedClass(SomeAbstractBase):
        ""

One possible use of ``__abstract__`` is to use a distinct
:class:`.MetaData` for different bases:

.. sourcecode:: python

    Base = declarative_base()

    class DefaultBase(Base):
        __abstract__ = True
        metadata = MetaData()

    class OtherBase(Base):
        __abstract__ = True
        metadata = MetaData()

Above, classes which inherit from ``DefaultBase`` will use one
:class:`.MetaData` as the registry of tables, and those which inherit from
``OtherBase`` will use a different one. The tables themselves can then be
created perhaps within distinct databases:

.. sourcecode:: python

    DefaultBase.metadata.create_all(some_engine)
    OtherBase.metadata_create_all(some_other_engine)


``__table_cls__``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows the callable / class used to generate a :class:`.Table` to be customized.
This is a very open-ended hook that can allow special customizations
to a :class:`.Table` that one generates here:

.. sourcecode:: python

    class MyMixin(object):
        @classmethod
        def __table_cls__(cls, name, metadata, *arg, **kw):
            return Table(
                "my_" + name,
                metadata, *arg, **kw
            )

The above mixin would cause all :class:`.Table` objects generated to include
the prefix ``"my_"``, followed by the name normally specified using the
``__tablename__`` attribute.

``__table_cls__`` also supports the case of returning ``None``, which
causes the class to be considered as single-table inheritance vs. its subclass.
This may be useful in some customization schemes to determine that single-table
inheritance should take place based on the arguments for the table itself,
such as, define as single-inheritance if there is no primary key present:

.. sourcecode:: python

    class AutoTable(object):
        @declared_attr
        def __tablename__(cls):
            return cls.__name__

        @classmethod
        def __table_cls__(cls, *arg, **kw):
            for obj in arg[1:]:
                if (isinstance(obj, Column) and obj.primary_key) or \
                        isinstance(obj, PrimaryKeyConstraint):
                    return Table(*arg, **kw)

            return None

    class Person(AutoTable, Base):
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)

    class Employee(Person):
        employee_name = Column(String)

The above ``Employee`` class would be mapped as single-table inheritance
against ``Person``; the ``employee_name`` column would be added as a member
of the ``Person`` table.
