.. _flush_embedded_sql_expressions:

Embedding SQL Insert/Update Expressions into a Flush
=====================================================

This feature allows the value of a database column to be set to a SQL
expression instead of a literal value. It's especially useful for atomic
updates, calling stored procedures, etc. All you do is assign an expression to
an attribute::

    class SomeClass(object):
        pass
    mapper(SomeClass, some_table)

    someobject = session.query(SomeClass).get(5)

    # set 'value' attribute to a SQL expression adding one
    someobject.value = some_table.c.value + 1

    # issues "UPDATE some_table SET value=value+1"
    session.commit()

This technique works both for INSERT and UPDATE statements. After the
flush/commit operation, the ``value`` attribute on ``someobject`` above is
expired, so that when next accessed the newly generated value will be loaded
from the database.

.. _session_sql_expressions:

Using SQL Expressions with Sessions
====================================

SQL expressions and strings can be executed via the
:class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session` within its transactional context.
This is most easily accomplished using the
:meth:`~.Session.execute` method, which returns a
:class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.ResultProxy` in the same manner as an
:class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Engine` or
:class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Connection`::

    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()

    # execute a string statement
    result = session.execute("select * from table where id=:id", {'id':7})

    # execute a SQL expression construct
    result = session.execute(select([mytable]).where(mytable.c.id==7))

The current :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Connection` held by the
:class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session` is accessible using the
:meth:`~.Session.connection` method::

    connection = session.connection()

The examples above deal with a :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session` that's
bound to a single :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Engine` or
:class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Connection`. To execute statements using a
:class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session` which is bound either to multiple
engines, or none at all (i.e. relies upon bound metadata), both
:meth:`~.Session.execute` and
:meth:`~.Session.connection` accept a ``mapper`` keyword
argument, which is passed a mapped class or
:class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.mapper.Mapper` instance, which is used to locate the
proper context for the desired engine::

    Session = sessionmaker()
    session = Session()

    # need to specify mapper or class when executing
    result = session.execute("select * from table where id=:id", {'id':7}, mapper=MyMappedClass)

    result = session.execute(select([mytable], mytable.c.id==7), mapper=MyMappedClass)

    connection = session.connection(MyMappedClass)

.. _session_partitioning:

Partitioning Strategies
=======================

Simple Vertical Partitioning
----------------------------

Vertical partitioning places different kinds of objects, or different tables,
across multiple databases::

    engine1 = create_engine('postgresql://db1')
    engine2 = create_engine('postgresql://db2')

    Session = sessionmaker(twophase=True)

    # bind User operations to engine 1, Account operations to engine 2
    Session.configure(binds={User:engine1, Account:engine2})

    session = Session()

Above, operations against either class will make usage of the :class:`.Engine`
linked to that class.   Upon a flush operation, similar rules take place
to ensure each class is written to the right database.

The transactions among the multiple databases can optionally be coordinated
via two phase commit, if the underlying backend supports it.  See
:ref:`session_twophase` for an example.

Custom Vertical Partitioning
----------------------------

More comprehensive rule-based class-level partitioning can be built by
overriding the :meth:`.Session.get_bind` method.   Below we illustrate
a custom :class:`.Session` which delivers the following rules:

1. Flush operations are delivered to the engine named ``master``.

2. Operations on objects that subclass ``MyOtherClass`` all
   occur on the ``other`` engine.

3. Read operations for all other classes occur on a random
   choice of the ``slave1`` or ``slave2`` database.

::

    engines = {
        'master':create_engine("sqlite:///master.db"),
        'other':create_engine("sqlite:///other.db"),
        'slave1':create_engine("sqlite:///slave1.db"),
        'slave2':create_engine("sqlite:///slave2.db"),
    }

    from sqlalchemy.orm import Session, sessionmaker
    import random

    class RoutingSession(Session):
        def get_bind(self, mapper=None, clause=None):
            if mapper and issubclass(mapper.class_, MyOtherClass):
                return engines['other']
            elif self._flushing:
                return engines['master']
            else:
                return engines[
                    random.choice(['slave1','slave2'])
                ]

The above :class:`.Session` class is plugged in using the ``class_``
argument to :class:`.sessionmaker`::

    Session = sessionmaker(class_=RoutingSession)

This approach can be combined with multiple :class:`.MetaData` objects,
using an approach such as that of using the declarative ``__abstract__``
keyword, described at :ref:`declarative_abstract`.

Horizontal Partitioning
-----------------------

Horizontal partitioning partitions the rows of a single table (or a set of
tables) across multiple databases.

See the "sharding" example: :ref:`examples_sharding`.

.. _bulk_operations:

Bulk Operations
===============

.. note::  Bulk Operations mode is a new series of operations made available
   on the :class:`.Session` object for the purpose of invoking INSERT and
   UPDATE statements with greatly reduced Python overhead, at the expense
   of much less functionality, automation, and error checking.
   As of SQLAlchemy 1.0, these features should be considered as "beta", and
   additionally are intended for advanced users.

.. versionadded:: 1.0.0

Bulk operations on the :class:`.Session` include :meth:`.Session.bulk_save_objects`,
:meth:`.Session.bulk_insert_mappings`, and :meth:`.Session.bulk_update_mappings`.
The purpose of these methods is to directly expose internal elements of the unit of work system,
such that facilities for emitting INSERT and UPDATE statements given dictionaries
or object states can be utilized alone, bypassing the normal unit of work
mechanics of state, relationship and attribute management.   The advantages
to this approach is strictly one of reduced Python overhead:

* The flush() process, including the survey of all objects, their state,
  their cascade status, the status of all objects associated with them
  via :func:`.relationship`, and the topological sort of all operations to
  be performed is completely bypassed.  This reduces a great amount of
  Python overhead.

* The objects as given have no defined relationship to the target
  :class:`.Session`, even when the operation is complete, meaning there's no
  overhead in attaching them or managing their state in terms of the identity
  map or session.

* The :meth:`.Session.bulk_insert_mappings` and :meth:`.Session.bulk_update_mappings`
  methods accept lists of plain Python dictionaries, not objects; this further
  reduces a large amount of overhead associated with instantiating mapped
  objects and assigning state to them, which normally is also subject to
  expensive tracking of history on a per-attribute basis.

* The process of fetching primary keys after an INSERT also is disabled by
  default.   When performed correctly, INSERT statements can now more readily
  be batched by the unit of work process into ``executemany()`` blocks, which
  perform vastly better than individual statement invocations.

* UPDATE statements can similarly be tailored such that all attributes
  are subject to the SET clase unconditionally, again making it much more
  likely that ``executemany()`` blocks can be used.

The performance behavior of the bulk routines should be studied using the
:ref:`examples_performance` example suite.  This is a series of example
scripts which illustrate Python call-counts across a variety of scenarios,
including bulk insert and update scenarios.

.. seealso::

  :ref:`examples_performance` - includes detailed examples of bulk operations
  contrasted against traditional Core and ORM methods, including performance
  metrics.

Usage
-----

The methods each work in the context of the :class:`.Session` object's
transaction, like any other::

    s = Session()
    objects = [
        User(name="u1"),
        User(name="u2"),
        User(name="u3")
    ]
    s.bulk_save_objects(objects)

For :meth:`.Session.bulk_insert_mappings`, and :meth:`.Session.bulk_update_mappings`,
dictionaries are passed::

    s.bulk_insert_mappings(User,
      [dict(name="u1"), dict(name="u2"), dict(name="u3")]
    )

.. seealso::

    :meth:`.Session.bulk_save_objects`

    :meth:`.Session.bulk_insert_mappings`

    :meth:`.Session.bulk_update_mappings`


Comparison to Core Insert / Update Constructs
---------------------------------------------

The bulk methods offer performance that under particular circumstances
can be close to that of using the core :class:`.Insert` and
:class:`.Update` constructs in an "executemany" context (for a description
of "executemany", see :ref:`execute_multiple` in the Core tutorial).
In order to achieve this, the
:paramref:`.Session.bulk_insert_mappings.return_defaults`
flag should be disabled so that rows can be batched together.   The example
suite in :ref:`examples_performance` should be carefully studied in order
to gain familiarity with how fast bulk performance can be achieved.

ORM Compatibility
-----------------

The bulk insert / update methods lose a significant amount of functionality
versus traditional ORM use.   The following is a listing of features that
are **not available** when using these methods:

* persistence along :func:`.relationship` linkages

* sorting of rows within order of dependency; rows are inserted or updated
  directly in the order in which they are passed to the methods

* Session-management on the given objects, including attachment to the
  session, identity map management.

* Functionality related to primary key mutation, ON UPDATE cascade

* SQL expression inserts / updates (e.g. :ref:`flush_embedded_sql_expressions`)

* ORM events such as :meth:`.MapperEvents.before_insert`, etc.  The bulk
  session methods have no event support.

Features that **are available** include:

* INSERTs and UPDATEs of mapped objects

* Version identifier support

* Multi-table mappings, such as joined-inheritance - however, an object
  to be inserted across multiple tables either needs to have primary key
  identifiers fully populated ahead of time, else the
  :paramref:`.Session.bulk_save_objects.return_defaults` flag must be used,
  which will greatly reduce the performance benefits
