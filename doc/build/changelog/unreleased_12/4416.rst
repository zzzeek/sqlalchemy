   Fixed issue where a :class:`.postgresql.ENUM` or a custom domain present
   in a remote schema would not be recognized within column reflection if
   the name of the enum/domain or the name of the schema required quoting.
   A new parsing scheme now fully parses out quoted or non-quoted tokens
   including support for SQL-escaped quotes.

.. change::
   :tags: bug, postgresql

   Fixed issue where multiple :class:`.postgresql.ENUM` objects referred to
   by the same :class:`.MetaData` object would fail to be created if
   multiple objects had the same name under different schema names.  The
   internal memoization the PostgreSQL dialect uses to track if it has
   created a particular :class:`.postgresql.ENUM` in the database during
   a DDL creation sequence now takes schema name into account.
