    Added new method :meth:`.baked.Result.with_post_criteria` to baked
    query system, allowing non-SQL-modifying transformations to take place
    after the query has been pulled from the cache.  Among other things,
    this method can be used with :class:`.horizontal_shard.ShardedQuery`
    to set the shard identifier.   :class:`.horizontal_shard.ShardedQuery`
    has also been modified such that its :meth:`.ShardedQuery.get` method
    interacts correctly with that of :class:`.baked.Result`.
