.. changelog::
    :version: 1.2.15
    :released: December 11, 2018

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 4367

        Fixed bug where the ORM annotations could be incorrect for the
        primaryjoin/secondaryjoin a relationship if one used the pattern
        ``ForeignKey(SomeClass.id)`` in the declarative mappings.   This pattern
        would leak undesired annotations into the join conditions which can break
        aliasing operations done within :class:`.Query` that are not supposed to
        impact elements in that join condition.  These annotations are now removed
        up front if present.

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, orm, declarative
       :tickets: 4374

       A warning is emitted in the case that a :func:`.column` object is applied to
       a declarative class, as it seems likely this intended to be a
       :class:`.Column` object.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 4366

        In continuing with a similar theme as that of very recent :ticket:`4349`,
        repaired issue with :meth:`.RelationshipProperty.Comparator.any` and
        :meth:`.RelationshipProperty.Comparator.has` where the "secondary"
        selectable needs to be explicitly part of the FROM clause in the
        EXISTS subquery to suit the case where this "secondary" is a :class:`.Join`
        object.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 4363

        Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`4349` where adding the "secondary"
        table to the FROM clause for a dynamic loader would affect the ability of
        the :class:`.Query` to make a subsequent join to another entity.   The fix
        adds the primary entity as the first element of the FROM list since
        :meth:`.Query.join` wants to jump from that.   Version 1.3 will have
        a more comprehensive solution to this problem as well (:ticket:`4365`).




    .. change::
       :tags: bug, orm
       :tickests: 4400

       Fixed bug where chaining of mapper options using
       :meth:`.RelationshipProperty.of_type` in conjunction with a chained option
       that refers to an attribute name by string only would fail to locate the
       attribute.

    .. change::
        :tag: feature, mysql
        :tickets: 4381

        Added support for the ``write_timeout`` flag accepted by mysqlclient and
        pymysql to  be passed in the URL string.

    .. change::
       :tag: bug, postgresql
       :tickets: 4377, 4380

       Fixed issue where reflection of a PostgreSQL domain that is expressed as an
       array would fail to be recognized.  Pull request courtesy Jakub Synowiec.


.. changelog::
    :version: 1.2.14
    :released: November 10, 2018

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, orm
       :tickets: 4357

       Fixed bug in :meth:`.Session.bulk_update_mappings` where alternate mapped
       attribute names would result in the primary key column of the UPDATE
       statement being included in the SET clause, as well as the WHERE clause;
       while usually harmless, for SQL Server this can raise an error due to the
       IDENTITY column.  This is a continuation of the same bug that was fixed in
       :ticket:`3849`, where testing was insufficient to catch this additional
       flaw.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 4361

        Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`4344` released in 1.2.13, where the fix
        for MySQL 8.0's case sensitivity problem with referenced column names when
        reflecting foreign key referents is worked around using the
        ``information_schema.columns`` view.  The workaround was failing on OSX /
        ``lower_case_table_names=2`` which produces non-matching casing for the
        ``information_schema.columns`` vs. that of ``SHOW CREATE TABLE``, so in
        case-insensitive SQL modes case-insensitive matching is now used.

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, orm
       :tickets: 4347

       Fixed a minor performance issue which could in some cases add unnecessary
       overhead to result fetching, involving the use of ORM columns and entities
       that include those same columns at the same time within a query.  The issue
       has to do with hash / eq overhead when referring to the column in different
       ways.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.2.13
    :released: October 31, 2018

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, postgresql
       :tickets: 4337

       Added support for the :class:`.aggregate_order_by` function to receive
       multiple ORDER BY elements, previously only a single element was accepted.


    .. change::
       :tags: bug, mysql
       :tickets: 4348

       Added word ``function`` to the list of reserved words for MySQL, which is
       now a keyword in MySQL 8.0

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, sql
        :versions: 1.3.0b1

        Refactored :class:`.SQLCompiler` to expose a
        :meth:`.SQLCompiler.group_by_clause` method similar to the
        :meth:`.SQLCompiler.order_by_clause` and :meth:`.SQLCompiler.limit_clause`
        methods, which can be overridden by dialects to customize how GROUP BY
        renders.  Pull request courtesy Samuel Chou.

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, misc

       Fixed issue where part of the utility language helper internals was passing
       the wrong kind of argument to the Python ``__import__`` builtin as the list
       of modules to be imported.  The issue produced no symptoms within the core
       library but could cause issues with external applications that redefine the
       ``__import__`` builtin or otherwise instrument it. Pull request courtesy Joe
       Urciuoli.

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, orm
       :tickets: 4349

       Fixed bug where "dynamic" loader needs to explicitly set the "secondary"
       table in the FROM clause of the query, to suit the case where the secondary
       is a join object that is otherwise not pulled into the query from its
       columns alone.


    .. change::
       :tags: bug, orm, declarative
       :tickets: 4350

       Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`4326` in version 1.2.12 where using
       :class:`.declared_attr` with a mixin in conjunction with
       :func:`.orm.synonym` would fail to map the synonym properly to an inherited
       subclass.

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, misc, py3k
       :tickets: 4339

       Fixed additional warnings generated by Python 3.7 due to changes in the
       organization of the Python ``collections`` and ``collections.abc`` packages.
       Previous ``collections`` warnings were fixed in version 1.2.11. Pull request
       courtesy xtreak.

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, ext

       Added missing ``.index()`` method to list-based association collections
       in the association proxy extension.

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, mysql
       :tickets: 4344

       Added a workaround for a MySQL bug #88718 introduced in the 8.0 series,
       where the reflection of a foreign key constraint is not reporting the
       correct case sensitivity for the referred column, leading to errors during
       use of the reflected constraint such as when using the automap extension.
       The workaround emits an additional query to the information_schema tables in
       order to retrieve the correct case sensitive name.

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, sql
       :tickets: 4341

       Fixed bug where the :paramref:`.Enum.create_constraint` flag on  the
       :class:`.Enum` datatype would not be propagated to copies of the type, which
       affects use cases such as declarative mixins and abstract bases.

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, orm, declarative
       :tickets: 4352

       The column conflict resolution technique discussed at
       :ref:`declarative_column_conflicts` is now functional for a :class:`.Column`
       that is also a primary key column.  Previously, a check for primary key
       columns declared on a single-inheritance subclass would occur before the
       column copy were allowed to pass.


.. changelog::
    :version: 1.2.12
    :released: September 19, 2018

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, postgresql
        :tickets: 4325

        Fixed bug in PostgreSQL dialect where compiler keyword arguments such as
        ``literal_binds=True`` were not being propagated to a DISTINCT ON
        expression.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, ext
        :tickets: 4328

        Fixed issue where :class:`.BakedQuery` did not include the specific query
        class used by the :class:`.Session` as part of the cache key, leading to
        incompatibilities when using custom query classes, in particular the
        :class:`.ShardedQuery` which has some different argument signatures.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, postgresql
        :tickets: 4324

        Fixed the :func:`.postgresql.array_agg` function, which is a slightly
        altered version of the usual :func:`.functions.array_agg` function, to also
        accept an incoming "type" argument without forcing an ARRAY around it,
        essentially the same thing that was fixed for the generic function in 1.1
        in :ticket:`4107`.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, postgresql
        :tickets: 4323

        Fixed bug in PostgreSQL ENUM reflection where a case-sensitive, quoted name
        would be reported by the query including quotes, which would not match a
        target column during table reflection as the quotes needed to be stripped
        off.


    .. change::
       :tags: bug, orm

       Added a check within the weakref cleanup for the :class:`.InstanceState`
       object to check for the presence of the ``dict`` builtin, in an effort to
       reduce error messages generated when these cleanups occur during interpreter
       shutdown.  Pull request courtesy Romuald Brunet.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, declarative
        :tickets: 4326

        Fixed bug where the declarative scan for attributes would receive the
        expression proxy delivered by a hybrid attribute at the class level, and
        not the hybrid attribute itself, when receiving the descriptor via the
        ``@declared_attr`` callable on a subclass of an already-mapped class. This
        would lead to an attribute that did not report itself as a hybrid when
        viewed within :attr:`.Mapper.all_orm_descriptors`.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 4334
        :versions: 1.3.0b1

        Fixed bug where use of :class:`.Lateral` construct in conjunction with
        :meth:`.Query.join` as well as :meth:`.Query.select_entity_from` would not
        apply clause adaption to the right side of the join.   "lateral" introduces
        the use case of the right side of a join being correlatable.  Previously,
        adaptation of this clause wasn't considered.   Note that in 1.2 only,
        a selectable introduced by :meth:`.Query.subquery` is still not adapted
        due to :ticket:`4304`; the selectable needs to be produced by the
        :func:`.select` function to be the right side of the "lateral" join.

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, oracle
       :tickets: 4335

       Fixed issue for cx_Oracle 7.0 where the behavior of Oracle param.getvalue()
       now returns a list, rather than a single scalar value, breaking
       autoincrement logic throughout the Core and ORM. The dml_ret_array_val
       compatibility flag is used for cx_Oracle 6.3 and 6.4 to establish compatible
       behavior with 7.0 and forward, for cx_Oracle 6.2.1 and prior a version
       number check falls back to the old logic.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 4327

        Fixed 1.2 regression caused by :ticket:`3472` where the handling of an
        "updated_at" style column within the context of a post-update operation
        would also occur for a row that is to be deleted following the update,
        meaning both that a column with a Python-side value generator would show
        the now-deleted value that was emitted for the UPDATE before the DELETE
        (which was not the previous behavor), as well as that a SQL- emitted value
        generator would have the attribute expired, meaning the previous value
        would be unreachable due to the row having been deleted and the object
        detached from the session.The "postfetch" logic that was added as part of
        :ticket:`3472` is now skipped entirely for an object that ultimately is to
        be deleted.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.2.11
    :released: August 20, 2018

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k

        Started importing "collections" from "collections.abc" under Python 3.3 and
        greater for Python 3.8 compatibility.  Pull request courtesy Nathaniel
        Knight.

    .. change::
        :tag: bug, sqlite

        Fixed issue where the "schema" name used for a SQLite database within table
        reflection would not quote the schema name correctly.  Pull request
        courtesy Phillip Cloud.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 4320

        Fixed issue that is closely related to :ticket:`3639` where an expression
        rendered in a boolean context on a non-native boolean backend would
        be compared to 1/0 even though it is already an implcitly boolean
        expression, when :meth:`.ColumnElement.self_group` were used.  While this
        does not affect the user-friendly backends (MySQL, SQLite) it was not
        handled by Oracle (and possibly SQL Server).   Whether or not the
        expression is implicitly boolean on any database is now determined
        up front as an additional check to not generate the integer comparison
        within the compliation of the statement.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, oracle
        :tickets: 4309

        For cx_Oracle, Integer datatypes will now be bound to "int", per advice
        from the cx_Oracle developers.  Previously, using cx_Oracle.NUMBER caused a
        loss in precision within the cx_Oracle 6.x series.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, declarative
        :tickets: 4321

        Fixed issue in previously untested use case, allowing a declarative mapped
        class to inherit from a classically-mapped class outside of the declarative
        base, including that it accommodates for unmapped intermediate classes. An
        unmapped intermediate class may specify ``__abstract__``, which is now
        interpreted correctly, or the intermediate class can remain unmarked, and
        the classically mapped base class will be detected within the hierarchy
        regardless. In order to anticipate existing scenarios which may be mixing
        in classical mappings into existing declarative hierarchies, an error is
        now raised if multiple mapped bases are detected for a given class.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 4322

        Added missing window function parameters
        :paramref:`.WithinGroup.over.range_` and :paramref:`.WithinGroup.over.rows`
        parameters to the :meth:`.WithinGroup.over` and
        :meth:`.FunctionFilter.over` methods, to correspond to the range/rows
        feature added to the "over" method of SQL functions as part of
        :ticket:`3049` in version 1.1.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 4313

        Fixed bug where the multi-table support for UPDATE and DELETE statements
        did not consider the additional FROM elements as targets for correlation,
        when a correlated SELECT were also combined with the statement.  This
        change now includes that a SELECT statement in the WHERE clause for such a
        statement will try to auto-correlate back to these additional tables in the
        parent UPDATE/DELETE or unconditionally correlate if
        :meth:`.Select.correlate` is used.  Note that auto-correlation raises an
        error if the SELECT statement would have no FROM clauses as a result, which
        can now occur if the parent UPDATE/DELETE specifies the same tables in its
        additional set of tables; specify :meth:`.Select.correlate` explicitly to
        resolve.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.2.10
    :released: July 13, 2018

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 4300

        Fixed bug where a :class:`.Sequence` would be dropped explicitly before any
        :class:`.Table` that refers to it, which breaks in the case when the
        sequence is also involved in a server-side default for that table, when
        using :meth:`.MetaData.drop_all`.   The step which processes sequences
        to be dropped via non server-side column default functions is now invoked
        after the table itself is dropped.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 4295

        Fixed bug in :class:`.Bundle` construct where placing two columns of the
        same name would be de-duplicated, when the :class:`.Bundle` were used as
        part of the rendered SQL, such as in the ORDER BY or GROUP BY of the statement.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 4298

        Fixed regression in 1.2.9 due to :ticket:`4287` where using a
        :class:`.Load` option in conjunction with a string wildcard would result
        in a TypeError.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.2.9
    :released: June 29, 2018

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql

        Fixed percent-sign doubling in mysql-connector-python dialect, which does
        not require de-doubling of percent signs.   Additionally, the  mysql-
        connector-python driver is inconsistent in how it passes the column names
        in cursor.description, so a workaround decoder has been added to
        conditionally decode these randomly-sometimes-bytes values to unicode only
        if needed.  Also improved test support for mysql-connector-python, however
        it should be noted that this driver still has issues with unicode that
        continue to be unresolved as of yet.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mssql
        :tickets: 4288

        Fixed bug in MSSQL reflection where when two same-named tables in different
        schemas had same-named primary key constraints, foreign key constraints
        referring to one of the tables would have their columns doubled, causing
        errors.   Pull request courtesy Sean Dunn.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 4279

        Fixed regression in 1.2 due to :ticket:`4147` where a :class:`.Table` that
        has had some of its indexed columns redefined with new ones, as would occur
        when overriding columns during reflection or when using
        :paramref:`.Table.extend_existing`, such that the :meth:`.Table.tometadata`
        method would fail when attempting to copy those indexes as they still
        referred to the replaced column.   The copy logic now accommodates for this
        condition.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 4293

        Fixed bug in index reflection where on MySQL 8.0 an index that includes
        ASC or DESC in an indexed column specfication would not be correctly
        reflected, as MySQL 8.0 introduces support for returning this information
        in a table definition string.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 3505

        Fixed issue where chaining multiple join elements inside of
        :meth:`.Query.join` might not correctly adapt to the previous left-hand
        side, when chaining joined inheritance classes that share the same base
        class.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 4287

        Fixed bug in cache key generation for baked queries which could cause a
        too-short cache key to be generated for the case of eager loads across
        subclasses.  This could in turn cause the eagerload query to be cached in
        place of a non-eagerload query, or vice versa, for a polymorhic "selectin"
        load, or possibly for lazy loads or selectin loads as well.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sqlite

        Fixed issue in test suite where SQLite 3.24 added a new reserved word that
        conflicted with a usage in TypeReflectionTest.  Pull request courtesy Nils
        Philippsen.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, oracle
        :tickets: 4290
        :versions: 1.3.0b1

        Added a new event currently used only by the cx_Oracle dialect,
        :meth:`.DialectEvents.setiputsizes`.  The event passes a dictionary of
        :class:`.BindParameter` objects to DBAPI-specific type objects that will be
        passed, after conversion to parameter names, to the cx_Oracle
        ``cursor.setinputsizes()`` method.  This allows both visibility into the
        setinputsizes process as well as the ability to alter the behavior of what
        datatypes are passed to this method.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 4286

        Fixed bug in new polymorphic selectin loading where the BakedQuery used
        internally would be mutated by the given loader options, which would both
        inappropriately mutate the subclass query as well as carry over the effect
        to subsequent queries.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k
        :tickets: 4291

        Replaced the usage of inspect.formatargspec() with a vendored version
        copied from the Python standard library, as inspect.formatargspec()
        is deprecated and as of Python 3.7.0 is emitting a warning.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, ext
        :tickets: 4243
        :versions: 1.3.0b1

        Added new attribute :attr:`.Query.lazy_loaded_from` which is populated
        with an :class:`.InstanceState` that is using this :class:`.Query` in
        order to lazy load a relationship.  The rationale for this is that
        it serves as a hint for the horizontal sharding feature to use, such that
        the identity token of the state can be used as the default identity token
        to use for the query within id_chooser().

        :tickets: 4283

        Fixed bug in MySQLdb dialect and variants such as PyMySQL where an
        additional "unicode returns" check upon connection makes explicit use of
        the "utf8" character set, which in MySQL 8.0 emits a warning that utf8mb4
        should be used.  This is now replaced with a utf8mb4 equivalent.
        Documentation is also updated for the MySQL dialect to specify utf8mb4 in
        all examples.  Additional changes have been made to the test suite to use
        utf8mb3 charsets and databases (there seem to be collation issues in some
        edge cases with utf8mb4), and to support configuration default changes made
        in MySQL 8.0 such as explicit_defaults_for_timestamp as well as new errors
        raised for invalid MyISAM indexes.

        The :class:`.Update` construct now accommodates a :class:`.Join` object
        as supported by MySQL for UPDATE..FROM.  As the construct already
        accepted an alias object for a similar purpose, the feature of UPDATE
        against a non-table was already implied so this has been added.

        Fixed issue within the SQL Server dialect under Python 3 where when running
        against a non-standard SQL server database that does not contain either the
        "sys.dm_exec_sessions" or "sys.dm_pdw_nodes_exec_sessions" views, leading
        to a failure to fetch the isolation level, the error raise would fail due
        to an UnboundLocalError.

        Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`4256` (itself a regression fix for
        :ticket:`4228`) which breaks an undocumented behavior which converted for a
        non-sequence of entities passed directly to the :class:`.Query` constructor
        into a single-element sequence.  While this behavior was never supported or
        documented, it's already in use so has been added as a behavioral contract
        to :class:`.Query`.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 4270

        Fixed an issue that was both a performance regression in 1.2 as well as an
        incorrect result regarding the "baked" lazy loader, involving the
        generation of cache keys from the original :class:`.Query` object's loader
        options.  If the loader options were built up in a "branched" style using
        common base elements for multiple options, the same options would be
        rendered into the cache key repeatedly, causing both a performance issue as
        well as generating the wrong cache key.  This is fixed, along with a
        performance improvement when such "branched" options are applied via
        :meth:`.Query.options` to prevent the same option objects from being
        applied repeatedly.

        Fixed INSERT FROM SELECT with CTEs for the Oracle and MySQL dialects, where
        the CTE was being placed above the entire statement as is typical with
        other databases, however Oracle and MariaDB 10.2 wants the CTE underneath
        the "INSERT" segment. Note that the Oracle and MySQL dialects don't yet
        work when a CTE is applied to a subquery inside of an UPDATE or DELETE
        statement, as the CTE is still applied to the top rather than inside the
        subquery.

    .. change::
    	:tags: bug, orm
    	:tickets: 4256

    	Fixed regression in 1.2.7 caused by :ticket:`4228`, which itself was fixing
    	a 1.2-level regression, where the ``query_cls`` callable passed to a
    	:class:`.Session` was assumed to be a subclass of :class:`.Query`  with
    	class method availability, as opposed to an arbitrary callable.    In
    	particular, the dogpile caching example illustrates ``query_cls`` as a
    	function and not a :class:`.Query` subclass.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, engine
        :tickets: 4252

        Fixed connection pool issue whereby if a disconnection error were raised
        during the connection pool's "reset on return" sequence in conjunction with
        an explicit transaction opened against the enclosing :class:`.Connection`
        object (such as from calling :meth:`.Session.close` without a rollback or
        commit, or calling :meth:`.Connection.close` without first closing a
        transaction declared with :meth:`.Connection.begin`), a double-checkin would
        result, which could then lead towards concurrent checkouts of the same
        connection. The double-checkin condition is now prevented overall by an
        assertion, as well as the specific double-checkin scenario has been
        fixed.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, oracle
        :tickets: 4264

        The Oracle BINARY_FLOAT and BINARY_DOUBLE datatypes now participate within
        cx_Oracle.setinputsizes(), passing along NATIVE_FLOAT, so as to support the
        NaN value.  Additionally, :class:`.oracle.BINARY_FLOAT`,
        :class:`.oracle.BINARY_DOUBLE` and :class:`.oracle.DOUBLE_PRECISION` now
        subclass :class:`.Float`, since these are floating point datatypes, not
        decimal.  These datatypes were already defaulting the
        :paramref:`.Float.asdecimal` flag to False in line with what
        :class:`.Float` already does.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, oracle

        Added reflection capabilities for the :class:`.oracle.BINARY_FLOAT`,
        :class:`.oracle.BINARY_DOUBLE` datatypes.


    .. change::

    	The horizontal sharding extension now makes use of the identity token
    	added to ORM identity keys as part of :ticket:`4137`, when an object
    	refresh or column-based deferred load or unexpiration operation occurs.
    	Since we know the "shard" that the object originated from, we make
    	use of this value when refreshing, thereby avoiding queries against
    	other shards that don't match this object's identity in any case.

        Fixed issue where the "ambiguous literal" error message used when
        interpreting literal values as SQL expression values would encounter a

        Miguel Ventura.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mssql
        :tickets: 4250

        Fixed a 1.2 regression caused by :ticket:`4061` where the SQL Server
        "BIT" type would be considered to be "native boolean".  The goal here
        was to avoid creating a CHECK constraint on the column, however the bigger
        issue is that the BIT value does not behave like a true/false constant
        and cannot be interpreted as a standalone expression, e.g.
        "WHERE <column>".   The SQL Server dialect now goes back to being
        non-native boolean, but with an extra flag that still avoids creating
        the CHECK constraint.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, oracle
        :tickets: 4259

        Altered the Oracle dialect such that when an :class:`.Integer` type is in
        use, the cx_Oracle.NUMERIC type is set up for setinputsizes().  In
        SQLAlchemy 1.1 and earlier, cx_Oracle.NUMERIC was passed for all numeric
        types unconditionally, and in 1.2 this was removed to allow for better
        numeric precision.  However, for integers, some database/client setups
        will fail to coerce boolean values True/False into integers which introduces
        regressive behavior when using SQLAlchemy 1.2.  Overall, the setinputsizes
        logic seems like it will need a lot more flexibility going forward so this
        is a start for that.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, engine

        Fixed a reference leak issue where the values of the parameter dictionary
        used in a statement execution would remain referenced by the "compiled
        cache", as a result of storing the key view used by Python 3 dictionary
        keys().  Pull request courtesy Olivier Grisel.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 4128

        Fixed a long-standing regression that occurred in version
        1.0, which prevented the use of a custom :class:`.MapperOption`
        that alters the _params of a :class:`.Query` object for a
        lazy load, since the lazy loader itself would overwrite those
        parameters.   This applies to the "temporal range" example
        on the wiki.  Note however that the
        :meth:`.Query.populate_existing` method is now required in
        order to rewrite the mapper options associated with an object
        already loaded in the identity map.

        As part of this change, a custom defined
        :class:`.MapperOption` will now cause lazy loaders related to
        the target object to use a non-baked query by default unless
        the :meth:`.MapperOption._generate_cache_key` method is implemented.
        In particular, this repairs one regression which occured when
        using the dogpile.cache "advanced" example, which was not
        returning cached results and instead emitting SQL due to an
        incompatibility with the baked query loader; with the change,
        the ``RelationshipCache`` option included for many releases
        in the dogpile example will disable the "baked" query altogether.
        Note that the dogpile example is also modernized to avoid both
        of these issues as part of issue :ticket:`4258`.

    .. change::
    	:tags: bug, ext

    	Fixed a race condition which could occur if automap
    	:meth:`.AutomapBase.prepare` were used within a multi-threaded context
    	against other threads which  may call :func:`.configure_mappers` as a
    	result of use of other mappers.  The unfinished mapping work of automap
    	is particularly sensitive to being pulled in by a
    	:func:`.configure_mappers` step leading to errors.

        :tags: bug, orm

        Fixed bug where the new :meth:`.baked.Result.with_post_criteria`
        method would not interact with a subquery-eager loader correctly,
        in that the "post criteria" would not be applied to embedded
        subquery eager loaders.   This is related to :ticket:`4128` in that
        the post criteria feature is now used by the lazy loader.

    .. change::

    	:tickets: 4249

    	Fixed a bug in the test suite where if an external dialect returned

    	``AttributeError``.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 4258

        Updated the dogpile.caching example to include new structures that
        accommodate for the "baked" query system, which is used by default within
        lazy loaders and some eager relationship loaders. The dogpile.caching
        "relationship_caching" and "advanced" examples were also broken due to
        :ticket:`4256`.  The issue here is also worked-around by the fix in
        :ticket:`4128`.

        Fixed regression in 1.2 within sharded query feature where the
        new "identity_token" element was not being correctly considered within
        the scope of a lazy load operation, when searching the identity map
        for a related many-to-one element.   The new behavior will allow for
        making use of the "id_chooser" in order to determine the best identity
        key to retrieve from the identity map.  In order to achieve this, some
        refactoring of 1.2's "identity_token" approach has made some slight changes
        to the implementation of ``ShardedQuery`` which should be noted for other
        derivations of this class.

        Fixed issue where the compilation of an INSERT statement with the
        "literal_binds" option that also uses an explicit sequence and "inline"
        generation, as on PostgreSQL and Oracle, would fail to accommodate the
        extra keyword argument within the sequence processing routine.

    .. change::

        Fixed issue in single-inheritance loading where the use of an aliased
        entity against a single-inheritance subclass in conjunction with the
        :meth:`.Query.select_from` method would cause the SQL to be rendered with
        the unaliased table mixed in to the query, causing a cartesian product.  In
        particular this was affecting the new "selectin" loader when used against a
        single-inheritance subclass.

        Adjusted the SQL Server version detection for pyodbc to only allow for
        numeric tokens, filtering out non-integers, since the dialect does tuple-
        numeric comparisons with this value.  This is normally true for all known
        SQL Server / pyodbc drivers in any case.

        correctly.

        Fixed bug in connection pool where a connection could be present in the
        pool without all of its "connect" event handlers called, if a previous
        "connect" handler threw an exception; note that the dialects themselves
        have connect handlers that emit SQL, such as those which set transaction
        isolation, which can fail if the database is in a non-available state, but
        still allows a connection.  The connection is now invalidated first if any
        of the connect handlers fail.

        The minimum cx_Oracle version supported is 5.2 (June 2015).  Previously,
        the dialect asserted against version 5.0 but as of 1.2.2 we are using some
        symbols that did not appear until 5.2.

    .. change::

        Removed a warning that would be emitted when calling upon
        ``__table_args__``, ``__mapper_args__`` as named with a ``@declared_attr``
        method, when called from a non-mapped declarative mixin.  Calling these
        directly is documented as the approach to use when one is overidding one
        of these methods on a mapped class.  The warning still emits for regular
        attribute names.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 4215

        Fixed bug where using :meth:`.Mutable.associate_with` or
        :meth:`.Mutable.as_mutable` in conjunction with a class that has non-
        primary mappers set up with alternatively-named attributes would produce an
        attribute error.  Since non-primary mappers are not used for persistence,
        the mutable extension now excludes non-primary mappers from its
        instrumentation steps.

        Fixed bug in concrete inheritance mapping where user-defined
        attributes such as hybrid properties that mirror the names
        of mapped attributes from sibling classes would be overwritten by
        the mapper as non-accessible at the instance level.   Additionally
        ensured that user-bound descriptors are not implicitly invoked at the class
        level during the mapper configuration stage.

        The :class:`.URL` object now allows query keys to be specified multiple
        times where their values will be joined into a list.  This is to support
        the plugins feature documented at :class:`.CreateEnginePlugin` which
        documents that "plugin" can be passed multiple times. Additionally, the
        plugin names can be passed to :func:`.create_engine` outside of the URL

        Added support for :class:`.Enum` to persist the values of the enumeration,
        rather than the keys, when using a Python pep-435 style enumerated object.
        The user supplies a callable function that will return the string values to

        value-persistable as well.  Pull request courtesy Jon Snyder.

        which explicitly does not understand a quoted collation
        name.   Whether or not mixed-case collation names are

        Added a new data member to the identity key tuple
        used by the ORM's identity map, known as the
        "identity_token".  This token defaults to None but
        may be used by database sharding schemes to differentiate
        objects in memory with the same primary key that come
        from different databases.   The horizontal sharding
        extension integrates this token applying the shard
        identifier to it, thus allowing primary keys to be
        duplicated across horizontally sharded backends.

        SQL Server supports what SQLAlchemy calls "native boolean"
        with its BIT type, as this type only accepts 0 or 1 and the
        DBAPIs return its value as True/False.   So the SQL Server
        dialects now enable "native boolean" support, in that a
        CHECK constraint is not generated for a :class:`.Boolean`
        datatype.  The only difference vs. other native boolean
        is that there are no "true" / "false" constants so "1" and
        "0" are still rendered here.

        The cx_Oracle dialect has been reworked and modernized to take advantage of

        includes that the minimum cx_Oracle version is the 5.x series and that
        cx_Oracle 6.x is now fully tested. The most significant change involves
        type conversions, primarily regarding the numeric / floating point and LOB
        datatypes, making more effective use of cx_Oracle type handling hooks to
        simplify how bind parameter and result data is processed.

        that the overridden attribute will be ignored. This use
        case cannot be fully supported down to further subclasses without more

        in it being expunged from the session rather than being flushed.

        .. note::  This fix was inadvertently merged during the 1.2.0b3
           release and was **not added to the changelog** at that time.
           This changelog note was added to the release retroactively as of
           version 1.2.13.

        Fixed bug in :ref:`change_3948` which prevented "selectin" and
        "inline" settings in a multi-level class hierarchy from interacting
        together as expected.    A new example is added to the documentation.

        :tags: bug, oracle
        :tickets: 4042

        Fixed bug where an index reflected under Oracle with an expression like
        "column DESC" would not be returned, if the table also had no primary
        key, as a result of logic that attempts to filter out the
        index implicitly added by Oracle onto the primary key columns.

    .. change::
    	:tags: bug, orm
    	:tickets: 4071

    	Removed the warnings that are emitted when the LRU caches employed
    	by the mapper as well as loader strategies reach their threshold; the
    	purpose of this warning was at first a guard against excess cache keys
    	being generated but became basically a check on the "creating many
    	engines" antipattern.   While this is still an antipattern, the presense
    	of test suites which both create an engine per test as well as raise
    	on all warnings will be an inconvenience; it should not be critical
    	that such test suites change their architecture just for this warning
    	(though engine-per-test suite is always better).

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 4049

        Fixed regression where the use of a :func:`.undefer_group` option
        in conjunction with a lazy loaded relationship option would cause
        an attribute error, due to a bug in the SQL cache key generation
        added in 1.2 as part of :ticket:`3954`.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, oracle
        :tickets: 4045

        Fixed more regressions caused by cx_Oracle 6.0; at the moment, the only
        behavioral change for users is disconnect detection now detects for
        cx_Oracle.DatabaseError in addition to cx_Oracle.InterfaceError, as
        this behavior seems to have changed.   Other issues regarding numeric
        precision and uncloseable connections are pending with the upstream
        cx_Oracle issue tracker.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mssql
        :tickets: 4060

        Fixed bug where the SQL Server dialect could pull columns from multiple
        schemas when reflecting a self-referential foreign key constraint, if
        multiple schemas contained a constraint of the same name against a
        table of the same name.


    .. change::
        :tags: feature, mssql
        :tickets: 4058

        Added support for "AUTOCOMMIT" isolation level, as established
        via :meth:`.Connection.execution_options`, to the
        PyODBC and pymssql dialects.   This isolation level sets the
        appropriate DBAPI-specific flags on the underlying
        connection object.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 4073

        Modified the change made to the ORM update/delete evaluator in
        :ticket:`3366` such that if an unmapped column expression is present
        in the update or delete, if the evaluator can match its name to the
        mapped columns of the target class, a warning is emitted, rather than
        raising UnevaluatableError.  This is essentially the pre-1.2 behavior,
        and is to allow migration for applications that are currently relying
        upon this pattern.  However, if the given attribute name cannot be
        matched to the columns of the mapper, the UnevaluatableError is
        still raised, which is what was fixed in :ticket:`3366`.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 4087

        Fixed bug in new SQL comments feature where table and column comment
        would not be copied when using :meth:`.Table.tometadata`.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 4102

        In release 1.1, the :class:`.Boolean` type was broken in that
        boolean coercion via ``bool()`` would occur for backends that did not
        feature "native boolean", but would not occur for native boolean backends,
        meaning the string ``"0"`` now behaved inconsistently. After a poll, a
        consensus was reached that non-boolean values should be raising an error,
        especially in the ambiguous case of string ``"0"``; so the :class:`.Boolean`
        datatype will now raise ``ValueError`` if an incoming value is not
        within the range ``None, True, False, 1, 0``.

            :ref:`change_4102`

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 4063

        Refined the behavior of :meth:`.Operators.op` such that in all cases,
        if the :paramref:`.Operators.op.is_comparison` flag is set to True,
        the return type of the resulting expression will be
        :class:`.Boolean`, and if the flag is False, the return type of the
        resulting expression will be the same type as that of the left-hand
        expression, which is the typical default behavior of other operators.
        Also added a new parameter :paramref:`.Operators.op.return_type` as well
        as a helper method :meth:`.Operators.bool_op`.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 4072

        Changed the name of the ``.values`` attribute of the new MySQL
        INSERT..ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE construct to ``.inserted``, as
        :class:`.Insert` already has a method called :meth:`.Insert.values`.
        The ``.inserted`` attribute ultimately renders the MySQL ``VALUES()``
        function.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mssql, orm
        :tickets: 4062

        Added a new class of "rowcount support" for dialects that is specific to
        when "RETURNING", which on SQL Server looks like "OUTPUT inserted", is in
        use, as the PyODBC backend isn't able to give us rowcount on an UPDATE or
        DELETE statement when OUTPUT is in effect.  This primarily affects the ORM
        when a flush is updating a row that contains server-calcluated values,
        raising an error if the backend does not return the expected row count.
        PyODBC now states that it supports rowcount except if OUTPUT.inserted is
        present, which is taken into account by the ORM during a flush as to
        whether it will look for a rowcount.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 4088

        Internal refinements to the :class:`.Enum`, :class:`.Interval`, and
        :class:`.Boolean` types, which now extend a common mixin
        :class:`.Emulated` that indicates a type that provides Python-side
        emulation of a DB native type, switching out to the DB native type when a
        supporting backend is in use.   The PostgreSQL :class:`.INTERVAL` type
        when used directly will now include the correct type coercion rules for
        SQL expressions that also take effect for :class:`.sqltypes.Interval`
        (such as adding a date to an interval yields a datetime).


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mssql, orm

        Enabled the "sane_rowcount" flag for the pymssql dialect, indicating
        that the DBAPI now reports the correct number of rows affected from
        an UPDATE or DELETE statement.  This impacts mostly the ORM versioning
        feature in that it now can verify the number of rows affected on a
        target version.

    .. change:: 4028
        :tags: bug, engine
        :tickets: 4028

        Made some adjustments to :class:`.Pool` and :class:`.Connection` such
        that recovery logic is not run underneath exception catches for
        ``pool.Empty``, ``AttributeError``, since when the recovery operation
        itself fails, Python 3 creates a misleading stack trace referring to the
        ``Empty`` / ``AttributeError`` as the cause, when in fact these exception
        catches are part of control flow.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, oracle
        :tickets: 4076

        Fixed bug where Oracle 8 "non ansi" join mode would not add the
        ``(+)`` operator to expressions that used an operator other than the
        ``=`` operator.  The ``(+)`` needs to be on all columns that are part
        of the right-hand side.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mssql
        :tickets: 4059

        Added a rule to SQL Server index reflection to ignore the so-called
        "heap" index that is implicitly present on a table that does not
        specify a clustered index.

        Fixed regression from 1.1.11 where adding additional non-entity
        columns to a query that includes an entity with subqueryload
        relationships would fail, due to an inspection added in 1.1.11 as a
        result of :ticket:`4011`.

        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 4018

        The rules for type coercion between :class:`.Numeric`, :class:`.Integer`,
        and date-related types now include additional logic that will attempt
        to preserve the settings of the incoming type on the "resolved" type.
        Currently the target for this is the ``asdecimal`` flag, so that
        a math operation between :class:`.Numeric` or :class:`.Float` and
        :class:`.Integer` will preserve the "asdecimal" flag as well as
        if the type should be the :class:`.Float` subclass.

        :tickets: 4020

        The result processor for the :class:`.Float` type now unconditionally
        runs values through the ``float()`` processor if the dialect
        specifies that it also supports "native decimal" mode.  While most
        backends will deliver Python ``float`` objects for a floating point
        datatype, the MySQL backends in some cases lack the typing information
        in order to provide this and return ``Decimal`` unless the float
        conversion is done.

        :tickets: 4017

        Added some extra strictness to the handling of Python "float" values
        passed to SQL statements.  A "float" value will be associated with the
        :class:`.Float` datatype and not the Decimal-coercing :class:`.Numeric`
        datatype as was the case before, eliminating a confusing warning
        emitted on SQLite as well as unecessary coercion to Decimal.

    .. change:: 3058
        :tags: feature, orm
        :tickets: 3058

        Added a new feature :func:`.orm.with_expression` that allows an ad-hoc
        SQL expression to be added to a specific entity in a query at result
        time.  This is an alternative to the SQL expression being delivered as
        a separate element in the result tuple.

        An UPDATE emitted as a result of the
        :paramref:`.relationship.post_update` feature will now integrate with
        the versioning feature to both bump the version id of the row as well
        as assert that the existing version number was matched.

        ``__ixor__`` and ``__isub__`` for :class:`.mutable.MutableSet`
        and ``__iadd__`` for :class:`.mutable.MutableList` so that change

        A warning is emitted if the :attr:`.declared_attr.cascading` modifier
        is used with a declarative attribute that is itself declared on
        a class that is to be mapped, as opposed to a declarative mixin
        class or ``__abstract__`` class.  The :attr:`.declared_attr.cascading`
        modifier currently only applies to mixin/abstract classes.

    .. change:: 4003

        The Oracle dialect now inspects unique and check constraints when using
        :meth:`.Inspector.get_unique_constraints`,
        :meth:`.Inspector.get_check_constraints`.
        As Oracle does not have unique constraints that are separate from a unique
        :class:`.Index`, a :class:`.Table` that's reflected will still continue
        to not have :class:`.UniqueConstraint` objects associated with it.

        :tickets: 3948

        Added a new style of mapper-level inheritance loading
        "polymorphic selectin".  This style of loading
        emits queries for each subclass in an inheritance
        hierarchy subsequent to the load of the base
        object type, using IN to specify the desired
        primary key values.

        Repaired several use cases involving the
        :paramref:`.relationship.post_update` feature when used in conjunction
        with a column that has an "onupdate" value.   When the UPDATE emits,
        the corresponding object attribute is now expired or refreshed so that
        the newly generated "onupdate" value can populate on the object;
        previously the stale value would remain.  Additionally, if the target
        attribute is set in Python for the INSERT of the object, the value is
        now re-sent during the UPDATE so that the "onupdate" does not overwrite
        it (note this works just as well for server-generated onupdates).
        Finally, the :meth:`.SessionEvents.refresh_flush` event is now emitted
        for these attributes when refreshed within the flush.

    .. change:: 3996
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 3996

        Fixed bug where programmatic version_id counter in conjunction with
        joined table inheritance would fail if the version_id counter
        were not actually incremented and no other values on the base table
        were modified, as the UPDATE would have an empty SET clause.  Since
        programmatic version_id where version counter is not incremented
        is a documented use case, this specific condition is now detected
        and the UPDATE now sets the version_id value to itself, so that
        concurrency checks still take place.

    .. change:: 3848
        :tags: bug, orm, declarative
        :tickets: 3848

        Fixed bug where using :class:`.declared_attr` on an
        :class:`.AbstractConcreteBase` where a particular return value were some
        non-mapped symbol, including ``None``, would cause the attribute
        to hard-evaluate just once and store the value to the object
        dictionary, not allowing it to invoke for subclasses.   This behavior
        is normal when :class:`.declared_attr` is on a mapped class, and
        does not occur on a mixin or abstract class.  Since
        :class:`.AbstractConcreteBase` is both "abstract" and actually
        "mapped", a special exception case is made here so that the
        "abstract" behavior takes precedence for :class:`.declared_attr`.

        The versioning feature does not support NULL for the version counter.

        The operator precedence for all comparison operators such as LIKE, IS,
        IN, MATCH, equals, greater than, less than, etc. has all been merged
        into one level, so that expressions which make use of these against
        each other will produce parentheses between them.   This suits the
        stated operator precedence of databases like Oracle, MySQL and others
        which place all of these operators as equal precedence, as well as
        PostgreSQL as of 9.5 which has also flattened its operator precendence.

        is emitted for the table that cannot respond to ``DESCRIBE``,
        but the operation succeeds.

        session-wide, reducing memory use.   Also added new :class:`.Bakery`

        Fixed bug where combining a "with_polymorphic" load in conjunction
        with subclass-linked relationships that specify joinedload with
        innerjoin=True, would fail to demote those "innerjoins" to
        "outerjoins" to suit the other polymorphic classes that don't
        support that relationship.   This applies to both a single and a
        joined inheritance polymorphic load.

        Fixed bug where a :func:`.column_property` that is also marked as
        "deferred" would be marked as "expired" during a flush, causing it
        to be loaded along with the unexpiry of regular attributes even
        though this attribute was never accessed.

    .. change:: 3873

        Repaired issue where the type of an expression that used
        :meth:`.ColumnOperators.is_` or similar would not be a "boolean" type,
        instead the type would be "nulltype", as well as when using custom
        comparison operators against an untyped expression.   This typing can
        impact how the expression behaves in larger contexts as well as
        in result-row-handling.

        Improved the association proxy list collection so that premature
        autoflush against a newly created association object can be prevented
        in the case where ``list.append()`` is being used, and a lazy load
        would be invoked when the association proxy accesses the endpoint
        collection.  The endpoint collection is now accessed first before
        the creator is invoked to produce the association object.

        Fixed the negation of a :class:`.Label` construct so that the

        :tickets: 3944

        Added a new kind of eager loading called "selectin" loading.  This
        style of loading is very similar to "subquery" eager loading,
        except that it uses an IN expression given a list of primary key
        values from the loaded parent objects, rather than re-stating the
        original query.   This produces a more efficient query that is
        "baked" (e.g. the SQL string is cached) and also works in the
        context of :meth:`.Query.yield_per`.

        Fixed bug in subquery eager loading where the "join_depth" parameter
        for self-referential relationships would not be correctly honored,
        loading all available levels deep rather than correctly counting
        the specified number of levels for eager loading.

        Added warnings to the LRU "compiled cache" used by the :class:`.Mapper`
        (and ultimately will be for other ORM-based LRU caches) such that
        when the cache starts hitting its size limits, the application will
        emit a warning that this is a performance-degrading situation that
        may require attention.   The LRU caches can reach their size limits
        primarily if an application is making use of an unbounded number
        of :class:`.Engine` objects, which is an antipattern.  Otherwise,
        this may suggest an issue that should be brought to the SQLAlchemy
        developer's attention.

        Fixed bug to improve upon the specificity of loader options that
        take effect subsequent to the lazy load of a related entity, so
        that the loader options will match to an aliased or non-aliased
        entity more specifically if those options include entity information.

        The ``lazy="select"`` loader strategy now makes used of the
        :class:`.BakedQuery` query caching system in all cases.  This
        removes most overhead of generating a :class:`.Query` object and
        running it into a :func:`.select` and then string SQL statement from
        the process of lazy-loading related collections and objects.  The
        "baked" lazy loader has also been improved such that it can now
        cache in most cases where query load options are used.

        The system by which percent signs in SQL statements are "doubled"
        for escaping purposes has been refined.   The "doubling" of percent
        signs mostly associated with the :obj:`.literal_column` construct
        as well as operators like :meth:`.ColumnOperators.contains` now
        occurs based on the stated paramstyle of the DBAPI in use; for
        percent-sensitive paramstyles as are common with the PostgreSQL
        and MySQL drivers the doubling will occur, for others like that
        of SQLite it will not.   This allows more database-agnostic use
        of the :obj:`.literal_column` construct to be possible.

        PostgreSQL ``INTERVAL`` datatype, e.g. "YEAR", "MONTH", "DAY TO
        MINUTE", etc..   In addition, the :class:`.postgresql.INTERVAL`
        datatype itself now includes a new parameter
        :paramref:`.postgresql.INTERVAL.fields` where these qualifiers can be
        specified; the qualifier is also reflected back into the resulting
        datatype upon reflection / inspection.

        Fixed bug where a column-level :class:`.CheckConstraint` would fail
        to compile the SQL expression using the underlying dialect compiler
        as well as apply proper flags to generate literal values as
        inline, in the case that the sqltext is a Core expression and
        not just a plain string.   This was long-ago fixed for table-level
        check constraints in 0.9 as part of :ticket:`2742`, which more commonly
        feature Core SQL expressions as opposed to plain string expressions.

    .. change:: 2626

        The SQL Server dialect now allows for a database and/or owner name
        with a dot inside of it, using brackets explicitly in the string around
        the owner and optionally the database name as well.  In addition,
        sending the :class:`.quoted_name` construct for the schema name will
        not split on the dot and will deliver the full string as the "owner".
        :class:`.quoted_name` is also now available from the ``sqlalchemy.sql``
        import space.

        Added a new kind of :func:`.bindparam` called "expanding".  This is
        for use in ``IN`` expressions where the list of elements is rendered
        into individual bound parameters at statement execution time, rather
        than at statement compilation time.  This allows both a single bound
        parameter name to be linked to an IN expression of multiple elements,
        as well as allows query caching to be used with IN expressions.  The
        new feature allows the related features of "select in" loading and
        "polymorphic in" loading to make use of the baked query extension
        to reduce call overhead.   This feature should be considered to be
        **experimental** for 1.2.

        be executed properly upon INSERT in the "pre-execute" codepath, if the
        SQL itself were an untyped expression, such as plain text.  The "pre-

        quoted as an identifier when the name is case sensitive, e.g. has
        uppercase characters.  Note that this does not impact type-level

        The :meth:`.Query.update` method can now accommodate both
        hybrid attributes as well as composite attributes as a source
        of the key to be placed in the SET clause.   For hybrids, an
        additional decorator :meth:`.hybrid_property.update_expression`

        present within the object, as this is assumed to be present
        in the flush process.  To mark an object "dirty" for a flush

        The :class:`sqlalchemy.ext.hybrid.hybrid_property` class now supports
        calling mutators like ``@setter``, ``@expression`` etc. multiple times
        across subclasses, and now provides a ``@getter`` mutator, so that
        a particular hybrid can be repurposed across subclasses or other

        as well as via the :class:`.Inspector`.   Supported backends currently

        the engine as :paramref:`.create_engine.pool_pre_ping`, applies an
        efficient form of the "pre-ping" recipe featured in the pooling
        documentation, which upon each connection check out, emits a simple
        statement, typically "SELECT 1", to test the connection for liveness.
        If the existing connection is no longer able to respond to commands,
        the connection is transparently recycled, and all other connections
        made prior to the current timestamp are invalidated.

        Fixed bug where the use of an :class:`.Alias` object in a column
        context would raise an argument error when it tried to group itself
        into a parenthesized expression.   Using :class:`.Alias` in this way
        is not yet a fully supported API, however it applies to some end-user

        The "evaluate" strategy used by :meth:`.Query.update` and
        :meth:`.Query.delete` can now accommodate a simple
        object comparison from a many-to-one relationship to an instance,
        when the attribute names of the primary key / foreign key columns
        don't match the actual names of the columns.  Previously this would

        Added new attribute event :meth:`.AttributeEvents.bulk_replace`.
        This event is triggered when a collection is assigned to a
        relationship, before the incoming collection is compared with the
        existing one.  This early event allows for conversion of incoming
        non-ORM objects as well.  The event is integrated with the
        ``@validates`` decorator.

        The ``@validates`` decorator now allows the decorated method to receive
        objects from a "bulk collection set" operation that have not yet
        been compared to the existing collection.  This allows incoming values
        to be converted to compatible ORM objects as is already allowed
        from an "append" event.   Note that this means that the
        ``@validates`` method is called for **all** values during a collection
        assignment, rather than just the ones that are new.

        the dialect with which the :class:`.Compiled` object were generated

        When assigning a collection to an attribute mapped by a relationship,
        the previous collection is no longer mutated.  Previously, the old

        The cx_Oracle dialect now supports "sane multi rowcount", that is,
        when a series of parameter sets are executed via DBAPI
        ``cursor.executemany()``, we can make use of ``cursor.rowcount`` to
        verify the number of rows matched.  This has an impact within the
        ORM when detecting concurrent modification scenarios, in that
        some simple conditions can now be detected even when the ORM
        is batching statements, as well as when the more strict versioning
        feature is used, the ORM can still use statement batching.  The
        flag is enabled for cx_Oracle assuming at least version 5.0, which

        The longstanding behavior of the :meth:`.ColumnOperators.in_` and
        :meth:`.ColumnOperators.notin_` operators emitting a warning when
        the right-hand condition is an empty sequence has been revised;
        a simple "static" expression of "1 != 1" or "1 = 1" is now rendered
        by default, rather than pulling in the original left-hand
        expression.  This causes the result for a NULL column comparison
        against an empty set to change from NULL to true/false.  The
        behavior is configurable, and the old behavior can be enabled
        using the :paramref:`.create_engine.empty_in_strategy` parameter
        to :func:`.create_engine`.

        Oracle reflection now "normalizes" the name given to a foreign key

        insensitive name.  This was already the behavior for indexes
        and primary key constraints as well as all table and column names.
        This will allow Alembic autogenerate scripts to compare and render
