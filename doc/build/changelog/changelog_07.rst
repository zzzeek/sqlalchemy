    :version: 0.7.11

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, engine
        :tickets: 2851
        :versions: 0.8.3, 0.9.0b1

        The regexp used by the :func:`~sqlalchemy.engine.url.make_url` function now parses
        ipv6 addresses, e.g. surrounded by brackets.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2807
        :versions: 0.8.3, 0.9.0b1

        Fixed bug where list instrumentation would fail to represent a
        setslice of ``[0:0]`` correctly, which in particular could occur
        when using ``insert(0, item)`` with the association proxy.  Due
        to some quirk in Python collections, the issue was much more likely
        with Python 3 rather than 2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2801
        :versions: 0.8.3, 0.9.0b1

        Fixed regression dating back to 0.7.9 whereby the name of a CTE might
        not be properly quoted if it was referred to in multiple FROM clauses.

    .. change::
        :tags: mysql, bug
        :tickets: 2791
        :versions: 0.8.3, 0.9.0b1

        Updates to MySQL reserved words for versions 5.5, 5.6, courtesy
        Hanno Schlichting.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, bug, cte
        :tickets: 2783
        :versions: 0.8.3, 0.9.0b1

        Fixed bug in common table expression system where if the CTE were
        used only as an ``alias()`` construct, it would not render using the
        WITH keyword.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2784
        :versions: 0.8.3, 0.9.0b1

        Fixed bug in :class:`.CheckConstraint` DDL where the "quote" flag from a
        :class:`.Column` object would not be propagated.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2699
        :versions: 0.8.1

      Fixed bug when a query of the form:
      ``query(SubClass).options(subqueryload(Baseclass.attrname))``,
      where ``SubClass`` is a joined inh of ``BaseClass``,
      would fail to apply the ``JOIN`` inside the subquery
      on the attribute load, producing a cartesian product.
      The populated results still tended to be correct as additional
      rows are just ignored, so this issue may be present as a
      performance degradation in applications that are
      otherwise working correctly.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2689
        :versions: 0.8.1

      Fixed bug in unit of work whereby a joined-inheritance
      subclass could insert the row for the "sub" table
      before the parent table, if the two tables had no
      ForeignKey constraints set up between them.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, postgresql
        :tickets: 2676
        :versions: 0.8.0

      Added support for Postgresql's traditional SUBSTRING
      function syntax, renders as "SUBSTRING(x FROM y FOR z)"
      when regular ``func.substring()`` is used.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, tests
        :tickets: 2669
        :pullreq: 41

      Fixed an import of "logging" in test_execute which was not
      working on some linux platforms.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2674

      Improved the error message emitted when a "backref loop" is detected,
      that is when an attribute event triggers a bidirectional
      assignment between two other attributes with no end.
      This condition can occur not just when an object of the wrong
      type is assigned, but also when an attribute is mis-configured
      to backref into an existing backref pair.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, orm
      :tickets: 2674

      A warning is emitted when a MapperProperty is assigned to a mapper
      that replaces an existing property, if the properties in question
      aren't plain column-based properties.   Replacement of relationship
      properties is rarely (ever?) what is intended and usually refers to a
      mapper mis-configuration.   This will also warn if a backref configures
      itself on top of an existing one in an inheritance relationship
      (which is an error in 0.8).

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.7.10
    :released: Thu Feb 7 2013

    .. change::
        :tags: engine, bug
        :tickets: 2604
        :versions: 0.8.0b2

      Fixed :meth:`.MetaData.reflect` to correctly use
      the given :class:`.Connection`, if given, without
      opening a second connection from that connection's
      :class:`.Engine`.

    .. change::
        :tags: mssql, bug
        :tickets:2607
        :versions: 0.8.0b2

      Fixed bug whereby using "key" with Column
      in conjunction with "schema" for the owning
      Table would fail to locate result rows due
      to the MSSQL dialect's "schema rendering"
      logic's failure to take .key into account.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, mysql, gae
        :tickets: 2649

        Added a conditional import to the ``gaerdbms`` dialect which attempts
        to import rdbms_apiproxy vs. rdbms_googleapi to work
        on both dev and production platforms.  Also now honors the
        ``instance`` attribute.  Courtesy Sean Lynch.  Also backported
        enhancements to allow username/password as well as
        fixing error code interpretation from 0.8.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, bug
        :tickets: 2594, 2584

        Backported adjustment to ``__repr__`` for
        :class:`.TypeDecorator` to 0.7, allows :class:`.PickleType`
        to produce a clean ``repr()`` to help with Alembic.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, bug
        :tickets: 2643

        Fixed bug where :meth:`.Table.tometadata` would fail if a
        :class:`.Column` had both a foreign key as well as an
        alternate ".key" name for the column.

    .. change::
        :tags: mssql, bug
        :tickets: 2638

      Added a Py3K conditional around unnecessary .decode()
      call in mssql information schema, fixes reflection
      in Py3k.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2650

      Fixed potential memory leak which could occur if an
      arbitrary number of :class:`.sessionmaker` objects
      were created.   The anonymous subclass created by
      the sessionmaker, when dereferenced, would not be garbage
      collected due to remaining class-level references from the
      event package.  This issue also applies to any custom system
      that made use of ad-hoc subclasses in conjunction with
      an event dispatcher.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2640

      :meth:`.Query.merge_result` can now load rows from an outer join
      where an entity may be ``None`` without throwing an error.

    .. change::
        :tags: sqlite, bug
        :tickets: 2568
        :versions: 0.8.0b2

      More adjustment to this SQLite related issue which was released in
      0.7.9, to intercept legacy SQLite quoting characters when reflecting
      foreign keys.  In addition to intercepting double quotes, other
      quoting characters such as brackets, backticks, and single quotes
      are now also intercepted.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, bug
        :tickets: 2631
        :versions: 0.8.0b2

      Fixed bug where using server_onupdate=<FetchedValue|DefaultClause>
      without passing the "for_update=True" flag would apply the default
      object to the server_default, blowing away whatever was there.
      The explicit for_update=True argument shouldn't be needed with this usage
      (especially since the documentation shows an example without it being
      used) so it is now arranged internally using a copy of the given default
      object, if the flag isn't set to what corresponds to that argument.

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle, bug
        :tickets: 2620

      The Oracle LONG type, while an unbounded text type, does not appear
      to use the cx_Oracle.LOB type when result rows are returned,
      so the dialect has been repaired to exclude LONG from
      having cx_Oracle.LOB filtering applied.

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle, bug
        :tickets: 2611

      Repaired the usage of ``.prepare()`` in conjunction with
      cx_Oracle so that a return value of ``False`` will result
      in no call to ``connection.commit()``, hence avoiding
      "no transaction" errors.   Two-phase transactions have
      now been shown to work in a rudimental fashion with
      SQLAlchemy and cx_oracle, however are subject to caveats
      observed with the driver; check the documentation
      for details.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2624

      The :class:`.MutableComposite` type did not allow for the
      :meth:`.MutableBase.coerce` method to be used, even though
      the code seemed to indicate this intent, so this now works
      and a brief example is added.  As a side-effect,
      the mechanics of this event handler have been changed so that
      new :class:`.MutableComposite` types no longer add per-type
      global event handlers.  Also in 0.8.0b2.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2583

      Fixed Session accounting bug whereby replacing
      a deleted object in the identity map with another
      object of the same primary key would raise a
      "conflicting state" error on rollback(),
      if the replaced primary key were established either
      via non-unitofwork-established INSERT statement
      or by primary key switch of another instance.

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle, bug
        :tickets: 2561

      changed the list of cx_oracle types that are
      excluded from the setinputsizes() step to only include
      STRING and UNICODE; CLOB and NCLOB are removed.  This
      is to work around cx_oracle behavior which is broken
      for the executemany() call.  In 0.8, this same change
      is applied however it is also configurable via the
      exclude_setinputsizes argument.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, mysql
        :tickets: 2523

      Added "raise_on_warnings" flag to OurSQL
      dialect.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, mysql
        :tickets: 2554

      Added "read_timeout" flag to MySQLdb
      dialect.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.7.9
    :released: Mon Oct 01 2012

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets:

      Fixed bug mostly local to new
      AbstractConcreteBase helper where the "type"
      attribute from the superclass would not
      be overridden on the subclass to produce the
      "reserved for base" error message, instead placing
      a do-nothing attribute there.  This was inconsistent
      vs. using ConcreteBase as well as all the behavior
      of classical concrete mappings, where the "type"
      column from the polymorphic base would be explicitly
      disabled on subclasses, unless overridden
      explicitly.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets:

      A warning is emitted when lazy='dynamic'
      is combined with uselist=False.  This is an
      exception raise in 0.8.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets:

      Fixed bug whereby user error in related-object
      assignment could cause recursion overflow if the
      assignment triggered a backref of the same name
      as a bi-directional attribute on the incorrect
      class to the same target.  An informative
      error is raised now.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2539

      Fixed bug where incorrect type information
      would be passed when the ORM would bind the
      "version" column, when using the "version" feature.
      Tests courtesy Daniel Miller.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2566

      Extra logic has been added to the "flush"
      that occurs within Session.commit(), such that the
      extra state added by an after_flush() or
      after_flush_postexec() hook is also flushed in a
      subsequent flush, before the "commit" completes.
      Subsequent calls to flush() will continue until
      the after_flush hooks stop adding new state.
      An "overflow" counter of 100 is also in place,
      in the event of a broken after_flush() hook
      adding new content each time.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2571

      Fixed the DropIndex construct to support
      an Index associated with a Table in a remote
      schema.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2574

      Fixed bug in over() construct whereby
      passing an empty list for either partition_by
      or order_by, as opposed to None, would fail
      to generate correctly.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2521

      Fixed CTE bug whereby positional
      bound parameters present in the CTEs themselves
      would corrupt the overall ordering of
      bound parameters.  This primarily
      affected SQL Server as the platform with
      positional binds + CTE support.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets:

      Fixed more un-intuitivenesses in CTEs
      which prevented referring to a CTE in a union
      of itself without it being aliased.
      CTEs now render uniquely
      on name, rendering the outermost CTE of a given
      name only - all other references are rendered
      just as the name.   This even includes other
      CTE/SELECTs that refer to different versions
      of the same CTE object, such as a SELECT
      or a UNION ALL of that SELECT. We are
      somewhat loosening the usual link between object
      identity and lexical identity in this case.
      A true name conflict between two unrelated
      CTEs now raises an error.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2512

      quoting is applied to the column names
      inside the WITH RECURSIVE clause of a
      common table expression according to the
      quoting rules for the originating Column.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2518

      Fixed regression introduced in 0.7.6
      whereby the FROM list of a SELECT statement
      could be incorrect in certain "clone+replace"
      scenarios.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2552

      Fixed bug whereby usage of a UNION
      or similar inside of an embedded subquery
      would interfere with result-column targeting,
      in the case that a result-column had the same
      ultimate name as a name inside the embedded
      UNION.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2558

      Fixed a regression since 0.6 regarding
      result-row targeting.   It should be possible
      to use a select() statement with string
      based columns in it, that is
      select(['id', 'name']).select_from('mytable'),
      and have this statement be targetable by
      Column objects with those names; this is the
      mechanism by which
      query(MyClass).from_statement(some_statement)
      works.  At some point the specific case of
      using select(['id']), which is equivalent to
      select([literal_column('id')]), stopped working
      here, so this has been re-instated and of
      course tested.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2544

      Added missing operators is_(), isnot()
      to the ColumnOperators base, so that these long-available
      operators are present as methods like all
      the other operators.

    .. change::
        :tags: engine, bug
        :tickets: 2522

      Fixed bug whereby
      a disconnect detect + dispose that occurs
      when the QueuePool has threads waiting
      for connections would leave those
      threads waiting for the duration of
      the timeout on the old pool (or indefinitely
      if timeout was disabled).  The fix
      now notifies those waiters with a special
      exception case and has them move onto
      the new pool.

    .. change::
        :tags: engine, feature
        :tickets: 2516

      Dramatic improvement in memory
      usage of the event system; instance-level
      collections are no longer created for a
      particular type of event until
      instance-level listeners are established
      for that event.

      Added gaerdbms import to mysql/__init__.py,
      the absense of which was preventing the new
      GAE dialect from being loaded.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 2553

      Fixed cextension bug whereby the
      "ambiguous column error" would fail to
      function properly if the given index were
      a Column object and not a string.
      Note there are still some column-targeting
      issues here which are fixed in 0.8.

    .. change::
        :tags: sqlite, bug
        :tickets: 2568

      Adjusted a very old bugfix which attempted
      to work around a SQLite issue that itself was
      "fixed" as of sqlite 3.6.14, regarding quotes
      surrounding a table name when using
      the "foreign_key_list" pragma.  The fix has been
      adjusted to not interfere with quotes that
      are *actually in the name* of a column or table,
      to as much a degree as possible; sqlite still
      doesn't return the correct result for foreign_key_list()
      if the target table actually has quotes surrounding
      its name, as *part* of its name (i.e. """mytable""").

    .. change::

      Adjusted column default reflection code to

      Fixed compiler bug whereby using a correlated

      Fixed bug whereby subqueryload() from

      a new invocation of the query for each
      distinct class encountered in the polymorphic
      result.

      Fixed bug in declarative
      whereby the precedence of columns
      in a joined-table, composite
      column (typically for id) would fail to
      be correct if the columns contained
      names distinct from their attribute
      names.  This would cause things like
      primaryjoin conditions made against the
      entity attributes to be incorrect.  Related
      to as this was supposed
      to be part of that, this is.

      Added "no_parameters=True" execution
      option for connections.   If no parameters
      are present, will pass the statement
      as cursor.execute(statement), thereby invoking
      the DBAPIs behavior when no parameter collection
      is present; for psycopg2 and mysql-python, this
      means not interpreting % signs in the string.
      This only occurs with this option, and not
      just if the param list is blank, as otherwise
      this would produce inconsistent behavior
      of SQL expressions that normally escape percent
      signs (and while compiling, can't know ahead of
      time if parameters will be present in
      some cases).

      Fixed backref behavior when "popping" the
      value off of a many-to-one in response to
      a removal from a stale one-to-many - the operation
      is skipped, since the many-to-one has since
      been updated.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2264

      After some years of not doing this, added
      more granularity to the "is X a parent of Y"
      functionality, which is used when determining
      if the FK on "Y" needs to be "nulled out" as well
      as if "Y" should be deleted with delete-orphan
      cascade.   The test now takes into account the
      Python identity of the parent as well its identity
      key, to see if the last known parent of Y is
      definitely X.   If a decision
      can't be made, a StaleDataError is raised.  The
      conditions where this error is raised are fairly
      rare, requiring that the previous parent was
      garbage collected, and previously
      could very well inappropriately update/delete
      a record that's since moved onto a new parent,
      though there may be some cases where
      "silent success" occurred previously that will now
      raise in the face of ambiguity.
      Expiring "Y" resets the "parent" tracker, meaning
      X.remove(Y) could then end up deleting Y even
      if X is stale, but this is the same behavior
      as before; it's advised to expire X also in that
      case.

      the value of a composite attribute is now
      expired after an insert or update operation, instead
      of regenerated in place.  This ensures that a
      column value which is expired within a flush
      will be loaded first, before the composite
      is regenerated using that value.

      The fix in also emits the

      loaded on access, even if all column
      values were already present, as is appropriate.
      This fixes the "mutable" extension which relies

      are used to eliminate the additional WHERE..
      IN criterion normally tacked on with single

      related to, made some
      adjustments to the change from
      regarding the "from" list on a select(). The
      _froms collection is no longer memoized, as this
      simplifies various use cases and removes the
      need for a "warning" if a column is attached
      to a table after it was already used in an
      expression - the select() construct will now
      always produce the correct expression.
      There's probably no real-world
      performance hit here; select() objects are
      almost always made ad-hoc, and systems that
      wish to optimize the re-use of a select()
      would be using the "compiled_cache" feature.
      A hit which would occur when calling select.bind
      has been reduced, but the vast majority
      of users shouldn't be using "bound metadata"
      anyway :).

      will instead generate "UPDATE t1, t2, ..".  MySQL
      additionally can render against multiple tables in the

      Adjusted the "importlater" mechanism, which is
      used internally to resolve import cycles,
      such that the usage of __import__ is completed
      when the import of sqlalchemy or sqlalchemy.orm
      is done, thereby avoiding any usage of __import__
      after the application starts new threads,
      fixes.  Also in 0.6.9.

      Improved query.join() such that the "left" side
      can more flexibly be a non-ORM selectable,
      such as a subquery.   A selectable placed
      in select_from() will now be used as the left
      side, favored over implicit usage
      of a mapped entity.
      If the join still fails based on lack of
      foreign keys, the error message includes
      this detail.  Thanks to brianrhude
      on IRC for the test case.

            Allow concrete mappings using declarative which automatically
            set up the "polymorphic_union" when the "configure"
            mapper step is invoked.
          * The mapper itself has semi-private methods that allow

      Fixed bug regarding calculation of "from" list
      for a select() element.  The "from" calc is now
      delayed, so that if the construct uses a Column
      object that is not yet attached to a Table,
      but is later associated with a Table, it generates
      SQL using the table as a FROM.   This change
      impacted fairly deeply the mechanics of how
      the FROM list as well as the "correlates" collection
      is calculated, as some "clause adaption" schemes
      (these are used very heavily in the ORM)
      were relying upon the fact that the "froms"
      collection would typically be cached before the
      adaption completed.   The rework allows it
      such that the "froms" collection can be cleared
      and re-generated at any time.

      "NVARCHAR2" - there is no "NVARCHAR" on Oracle -
      this remains a slight breakage of the "uppercase types

      Feature enhancement: joined and subquery
      loading will now traverse already-present related
      objects and collections in search of unpopulated
      attributes throughout the scope of the eager load
      being defined, so that the eager loading that is
      specified via mappings or query options
      unconditionally takes place for the full depth,
      populating whatever is not already populated.
      Previously, this traversal would stop if a related
      object or collection were already present leading
      to inconsistent behavior (though would save on
      loads/cycles for an already-loaded graph). For a
      subqueryload, this means that the additional
      SELECT statements emitted by subqueryload will
      invoke unconditionally, no matter how much of the
      existing graph is already present (hence the
      controversy). The previous behavior of "stopping"
      is still in effect when a query is the result of
      an attribute-initiated lazyload, as otherwise an
      "N+1" style of collection iteration can become
      needlessly expensive when the same related object
      is encountered repeatedly. There's also an
      as-yet-not-public generative Query method
      _with_invoke_all_eagers()
      which selects old/new behavior

      Fixed bug whereby the source clause
      used by query.join() would be inconsistent

      Fixed bug whereby if a mapped class
      redefined __hash__() or __eq__() to something
      non-standard, which is a supported use case
      as SQLA should never consult these,
      the methods would be consulted if the class
      was part of a "composite" (i.e. non-single-entity)

      The join condition produced by with_parent
      as well as when using a "dynamic" relationship
      against a parent will generate unique

      Fixed bug whereby comparison of column
      expression to a Query() would not call
      as_scalar() on the underlying SELECT
      statement to produce a scalar subquery,
      in the way that occurs if you called
      it on Query().subquery().

      Fixed declarative bug where a class inheriting

      Fixed two subtle bugs involving column

      New feature: with_variant() method on

      Fixed bug whereby adaptation of old append_ddl_listener()
      function was passing unexpected \**kw through
      to the Table event.   Table gets no kws, the MetaData

      Fixed bug where "autoincrement" detection on

      Failures on connect which raise dbapi.Error
      will forward the error to dialect.is_disconnect()
      and set the "connection_invalidated" flag if
      the dialect knows this to be a potentially

      SQLite dialect no longer strips quotes
      off of reflected default value, allowing
      a round trip CREATE TABLE to work.

      Adjusted the pyodbc dialect such that bound
      values are passed as bytes and not unicode
      if the "Easysoft" unix drivers are detected.
      This is the same behavior as occurs with

      "delete-orphan" cascade is now allowed on

      Removed the "adjust casing" step that would
      fail when reflecting a table on MySQL
      on windows with a mixed case name.  After some
      experimenting with a windows MySQL server, it's
      been determined that this step wasn't really
      helping the situation much; MySQL does not return
      FK names with proper casing on non-windows
      platforms either, and removing the step at
      least allows the reflection to act more like
      it does on other OSes.   A warning here
      has been considered but its difficult to
      determine under what conditions such a warning
      can be raised, so punted on that for now -

      query.options(someoption("nonexistent name")) would
      fail to raise an error.  Also added additional

      Fine tuning of Query clause adaptation when
      from_self(), union(), or other "select from
      myself" operation, such that plain SQL expression
      elements added to filter(), order_by() etc.
      which are present in the nested "from myself"

      Fixed bug where determination of "self referential"

      mapper() will ignore non-configured foreign keys
      to unrelated tables when determining inherit
      condition between parent and child class,
      but will raise as usual for unresolved
      columns and table names regarding the inherited
      table.  This is an enhanced generalization of
      behavior that was already applied to declarative
      previously.    0.6.8 has a more
      conservative version of this which doesn't
      fundamentally alter how join conditions
      are determined.

      Fixed bug whereby nesting a label of a select()

      The changelog for 0.6.7 and subsequent within
      the 0.6 series is now listed only in the
      CHANGES file within the 0.6 branch.
      In the 0.7 CHANGES file (i.e. this file), all the
      0.6 changes are listed inline within the 0.7
      section in which they were also applied
      (since all 0.6 changes are in 0.7 as well).
      Changes that apply to an 0.6 version here
      are noted as are if any differences in
      implementation/behavior are present.

      Some fixes to "evaulate" and "fetch" evaluation
      when query.update(), query.delete() are called.
      The retrieval of records is done after autoflush
      in all cases, and before update/delete is
      emitted, guarding against unflushed data present
      as well as expired objects failing during
      the evaluation.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 2063

      Reworded the exception raised when a flush
      is attempted of a subclass that is not polymorphic
      against the supertype.

      Still more wording adjustments when a query option
      can't find the target entity.  Explain that the
      path must be from one of the root entities.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2123

      Some fixes to the state handling regarding
      backrefs, typically when autoflush=False, where
      the back-referenced collection wouldn't
      properly handle add/removes with no net
      change.  Thanks to Richard Murri for the
      test case + patch.
      (also in 0.6.7).

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2127

      Added checks inside the UOW to detect the unusual
      condition of being asked to UPDATE or DELETE
      on a primary key value that contains NULL
      in it.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2127

      Some refinements to attribute history.  More
      changes are pending possibly in 0.8, but
      for now history has been modified such that
      scalar history doesn't have a "side effect"
      of populating None for a non-present value.
      This allows a slightly better ability to
      distinguish between a None set and no actual
      change, affects as well.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2130

      a "having" clause would be copied from the
      inside to the outside query if from_self()
      were used; in particular this would break
      an 0.7 style count() query.
      (also in 0.6.7)

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2131

      the Query.execution_options() method now passes
      those options to the Connection rather than
      the SELECT statement, so that all available
      options including isolation level and
      compiled cache may be used.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2131

      The "compiled_cache" execution option now raises
      an error when passed to a SELECT statement
      rather than a Connection.  Previously it was
      being ignored entirely.   We may look into
      having this option work on a per-statement
      level at some point.

      Restored the "catchall" constructor on the base
      TypeEngine class, with a deprecation warning.
      This so that code which does something like
      Integer(11) still succeeds.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2104

      Fixed regression whereby MetaData() coming
      back from unpickling did not keep track of
      new things it keeps track of now, i.e.
      collection of Sequence objects, list
      of schema names.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 2116

      The limit/offset keywords to select() as well
      as the value passed to select.limit()/offset()
      will be coerced to integer.

      fixed bug where "from" clause gathering from an
      over() clause would be an itertools.chain() and
      not a list, causing "can only concatenate list"
      TypeError when combined with other clauses.

    .. change::

      Before/after attach events for PrimaryKeyConstraint

      on all constraint types.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2117

      Added explicit true()/false() constructs to expression
      lib - coercion rules will intercept "False"/"True"
      into these constructs.  In 0.6, the constructs were
      typically converted straight to string, which was
      no longer accepted in 0.7.

        :tickets: 2129

      The C extension is now enabled by default on CPython
      2.x with a fallback to pure python if it fails to
      compile.

    .. change::
        :tags: schema
        :tickets: 2109

      The 'useexisting' flag on Table has been superceded
      by a new pair of flags 'keep_existing' and
      'extend_existing'.   'extend_existing' is equivalent
      to 'useexisting' - the existing Table is returned,
      and additional constructor elements are added.
      With 'keep_existing', the existing Table is returned,
      but additional constructor elements are not added -
      these elements are only applied when the Table
      is newly created.

      REAL has been added to the core types.  Supported
      by Postgresql, SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite.  Note

      from those dialects.

      AssertionPool now stores the traceback indicating
      where the currently checked out connection was
      acquired; this traceback is reported within
      the assertion raised upon a second concurrent
      checkout; courtesy Gunnlaugur Briem

      pg8000.

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle
        :tickets: 2100

      Using column names that would require quotes
      for the column itself or for a name-generated
      bind parameter, such as names with special
      characters, underscores, non-ascii characters,
      now properly translate bind parameter keys when
      talking to cx_oracle.   (Also
      in 0.6.7)

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle
        :tickets: 2116

      Oracle dialect adds use_binds_for_limits=False
      create_engine() flag, will render the LIMIT/OFFSET
      values inline instead of as binds, reported to
      modify the execution plan used by Oracle. (Also in 0.6.7)

    .. change::

      Lots of fixes to unit tests when run under Pypy
      (courtesy Alex Gaynor).

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2093

      Changed the underlying approach to query.count().
      query.count() is now in all cases exactly:

          query.
              from_self(func.count(literal_column('1'))).
              scalar()

      That is, "select count(1) from (<full query>)".
      This produces a subquery in all cases, but
      vastly simplifies all the guessing count()
      tried to do previously, which would still
      fail in many scenarios particularly when
      joined table inheritance and other joins
      were involved.  If the subquery produced
      for an otherwise very simple count is really
      an issue, use query(func.count()) as an
      optimization.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2087

      some changes to the identity map regarding
      rare weakref callbacks during iterations.
      The mutex has been removed as it apparently
      can cause a reentrant (i.e. in one thread) deadlock,
      perhaps when gc collects objects at the point of
      iteration in order to gain more memory.  It is hoped
      that "dictionary changed during iteration" will
      be exceedingly rare as iteration methods internally
      acquire the full list of objects in a single values()
      call. Note 0.6.7 has a more conservative fix here
      which still keeps the mutex in place.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2082

      A tweak to the unit of work causes it to order
      the flush along relationship() dependencies even if
      the given objects don't have any inter-attribute
      references in memory, which was the behavior in
      0.5 and earlier, so a flush of Parent/Child with
      only foreign key/primary key set will succeed.
      This while still maintaining 0.6 and above's not
      generating a ton of useless internal dependency
      structures within the flush that don't correspond
      to state actually within the current flush.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2069

      Improvements to the error messages emitted when
      querying against column-only entities in conjunction
      with (typically incorrectly) using loader options,
      where the parent entity is not fully present.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2098

      Fixed bug in query.options() whereby a path
      applied to a lazyload using string keys could
      overlap a same named attribute on the wrong
      entity.  Note 0.6.7 has a more conservative fix
      to this.

    .. change::
        :tags: declarative
        :tickets: 2091

      Arguments in __mapper_args__ that aren't "hashable"
      aren't mistaken for always-hashable, possibly-column
      arguments.  (also in 0.6.7)

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets:

      Added a fully descriptive error message for the
      case where Column is subclassed and _make_proxy()
      fails to make a copy due to TypeError on the
      constructor.   The method _constructor should
      be implemented in this case.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2095

      Added new event "column_reflect" for Table objects.
      Receives the info dictionary about a Column before
      the object is generated within reflection, and allows
      modification to the dictionary for control over
      most aspects of the resulting Column including
      key, name, type, info dictionary.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets:

      To help with the "column_reflect" event being used
      with specific Table objects instead of all instances
      of Table, listeners can be added to a Table object
      inline with its construction using a new argument
      "listeners", a list of tuples of the form
      (<eventname>, <fn>), which are applied to the Table
      before the reflection process begins.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2085

      Added new generic function "next_value()", accepts
      a Sequence object as its argument and renders the
      appropriate "next value" generation string on the
      target platform, if supported.  Also provides
      ".next_value()" method on Sequence itself.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2084

      func.next_value() or other SQL expression can
      be embedded directly into an insert() construct,
      and if implicit or explicit "returning" is used
      in conjunction with a primary key column,
      the newly generated value will be present in
      result.inserted_primary_key.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2089

      Added accessors to ResultProxy "returns_rows",
      "is_insert" (also in 0.6.7)

        :tickets: 2071

      Rewrote the query used to get the definition of a view,
      typically when using the Inspector interface, to
      use sys.sql_modules instead of the information schema,
      thereby allowing views definitions longer than 4000
      characters to be fully returned.
      (also in 0.6.7)

    .. change::
        :tags: firebird
        :tickets: 2083

      The "implicit_returning" flag on create_engine() is

      The horizontal_shard ShardedSession class accepts the common

    .. change::

      Added logic which prevents the generation of

      from generating do-nothing events for all the methods
      not overridden.

    .. change::

      Fixed regression whereby composite() with
      Column objects placed inline would fail

      be inline with the composite() or external
      and pulled in via name or object ref.

      Renamed the EngineEvents event class to
      ConnectionEvents.  As these classes are never
      accessed directly by end-user code, this strictly
      is a documentation change for end users.  Also
      simplified how events get linked to engines
      and connections internally.

      The Sequence() construct, when passed a MetaData()
      object via its 'metadata' argument, will be

      The Column.references() method now returns True

      table.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 2065

      Fixed regression from 0.6 where SMALLINT and

      SMALLINT and BIGSERIAL

    .. change::

      Association proxy now has correct behavior for
      any(), has(), and contains() when proxying
      a many-to-one scalar attribute to a one-to-many
      collection (i.e. the reverse of the 'typical'
      association proxy use case)

      Beaker example now takes into account 'limit'

      Adjusted flush accounting step to occur before

      autocommit=True to work appropriately with
      expire_on_commit=True, and also allows post-flush session
      hooks to operate in the same transactional context
      as when autocommit=False.

      Session.merge() will check the version id of the incoming

      Additional tuning to "many-to-one" relationship
      loads during a flush().   A change in version 0.6.6
      ([ticket:2002]) required that more "unnecessary" m2o

      Established consistency when server_default is present

      nor do they come back in cursor.lastrowid (DBAPI).
      Ensured all backends consistently return None
      in result.inserted_primary_key for these. Regarding
      reflection for this case, reflection of an int PK col
      with a server_default sets the "autoincrement" flag to False,
      except in the case of a PG SERIAL col where we detected a
      sequence default.

      Bind parameters present in the "columns clause" of a select

      the String/Unicode types, and their counterparts VARCHAR/
      NVARCHAR, emit "max" as the length when no length is
      specified, so that the default length, normally '1'
      as per SQL server documentation, is instead
      'unbounded'.  This also occurs for the VARBINARY type..

      This behavior makes these types more closely compatible
      with Postgresql's VARCHAR type which is similarly unbounded
      when no length is specified.
