   Amended the :class:`.AnsiFunction` class, the base of common SQL
   functions like ``CURRENT_TIMESTAMP``, to accept positional arguments
   like a regular ad-hoc function.  This to suit the case that many of
   these functions on specific backends accept arguments such as
   "fractional seconds" precision and such.  If the function is created
   with arguments, it renders the parenthesis and the arguments.  If
   no arguments are present, the compiler generates the non-parenthesized form.
