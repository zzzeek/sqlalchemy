What's New in SQLAlchemy 1.1?
==============================

.. admonition:: About this Document

    This document describes changes between SQLAlchemy version 1.0,
    at the moment the current release series of SQLAlchemy,
    and SQLAlchemy version 1.1, which is the current development
    series of SQLAlchemy.

    As the 1.1 series is under development, issues that are targeted
    at this series can be seen under the
    `1.1 milestone <https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/issues?milestone=1.1>`_.
    Please note that the set of issues within the milestone is not fixed;
    some issues may be moved to later milestones in order to allow
    for a timely release.

    Document last updated: July 24, 2015.

Introduction
============

This guide introduces what's new in SQLAlchemy version 1.1,
and also documents changes which affect users migrating
their applications from the 1.0 series of SQLAlchemy to 1.1.

Please carefully review the sections on behavioral changes for
potentially backwards-incompatible changes in behavior.

Platform / Installer Changes
============================

Setuptools is now required for install
--------------------------------------

SQLAlchemy's ``setup.py`` file has for many years supported operation
both with Setuptools installed and without; supporting a "fallback" mode
that uses straight Distutils.  As a Setuptools-less Python environment is
now unheard of, and in order to support the featureset of Setuptools
more fully, in particular to support py.test's integration with it,
``setup.py`` now depends on Setuptools fully.

:ticket:`3489`

Enabling / Disabling C Extension builds is only via environment variable
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The C Extensions build by default during install as long as it is possible.
To disable C extension builds, the ``DISABLE_SQLALCHEMY_CEXT`` environment
variable was made available as of SQLAlchemy 0.8.6 / 0.9.4.  The previous
approach of using the ``--without-cextensions`` argument has been removed,
as it relies on deprecated features of setuptools.

.. _change_2528:

A UNION or similar of SELECTs with LIMIT/OFFSET/ORDER BY now parenthesizes the embedded selects
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An issue that, like others, was long driven by SQLite's lack of capabilities
has now been enhanced to work on all supporting backends.   We refer to a query that
is a UNION of SELECT statements that themselves contain row-limiting or ordering
features which include LIMIT, OFFSET, and/or ORDER BY::

    (SELECT x FROM table1 ORDER BY y LIMIT 1) UNION
    (SELECT x FROM table2 ORDER BY y LIMIT 2)

The above query requires parenthesis within each sub-select in order to
group the sub-results correctly.  Production of the above statement in
SQLAlchemy Core looks like::

    stmt1 = select([table1.c.x]).order_by(table1.c.y).limit(1)
    stmt2 = select([table1.c.x]).order_by(table2.c.y).limit(2)

    stmt = union(stmt1, stmt2)

Previously, the above construct would not produce parenthesization for the
inner SELECT statements, producing a query that fails on all backends.

The above formats will **continue to fail on SQLite**.
This is not a backwards-incompatible change, because the queries fail without
the parentheses as well; with the fix, the queries at least work on all other
databases.

In all cases, in order to produce a UNION of limited SELECT statements that
also works on SQLite, the subqueries must be a SELECT of an ALIAS::

    stmt1 = select([table1.c.x]).order_by(table1.c.y).limit(1).alias().select()
    stmt2 = select([table2.c.x]).order_by(table2.c.y).limit(2).alias().select()

    stmt = union(stmt1, stmt2)

This workaround works on all SQLAlchemy versions.  In the ORM, it looks like::

    stmt1 = session.query(Model1).order_by(Model1.y).limit(1).subquery().select()
    stmt2 = session.query(Model2).order_by(Model2.y).limit(1).subquery().select()

    stmt = session.query(Model1).from_statement(stmt1.union(stmt2))

The behavior here has many parallels to the "join rewriting" behavior
introduced in SQLAlchemy 0.9 in :ref:`feature_joins_09`; however in this case
we have opted not to add new rewriting behavior to accommodate this
case for SQLite.
The existing rewriting behavior is very complicated already, and the case of
UNIONs with parenthesized SELECT statements is much less common than the
"right-nested-join" use case of that feature.

.. _change_3504:

String / varlength types no longer represent "max" explicitly on reflection
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When reflecting a type such as :class:`.String`, :class:`.Text`, etc.
which includes a length, an "un-lengthed" type under SQL Server would
copy the "length" parameter as the value ``"max"``::

    >>> from sqlalchemy import create_engine, inspect
    >>> engine = create_engine('mssql+pyodbc://scott:tiger@ms_2008', echo=True)
    >>> engine.execute("create table s (x varchar(max), y varbinary(max))")
    >>> insp = inspect(engine)
    >>> for col in insp.get_columns("s"):
    ...     print col['type'].__class__, col['type'].length
    ...
    <class 'sqlalchemy.sql.sqltypes.VARCHAR'> max
    <class 'sqlalchemy.dialects.mssql.base.VARBINARY'> max

The "length" parameter in the base types is expected to be an integer value
or None only; None indicates unbounded length which the SQL Server dialect
interprets as "max".   The fix then is so that these lengths come
out as None, so that the type objects work in non-SQL Server contexts::

    >>> for col in insp.get_columns("s"):
    ...     print col['type'].__class__, col['type'].length
    ...
    <class 'sqlalchemy.sql.sqltypes.VARCHAR'> None
    <class 'sqlalchemy.dialects.mssql.base.VARBINARY'> None

Applications which may have been relying on a direct comparison of the "length"
value to the string "max" should consider the value of ``None`` to mean
the same thing.
