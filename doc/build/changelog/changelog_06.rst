.. changelog::
    :version: 0.6.9
    :released: Sat May 05 2012

    .. change::
        :tags: general
        :tickets: 2279

      Adjusted the "importlater" mechanism, which is
      used internally to resolve import cycles,
      such that the usage of __import__ is completed
      when the import of sqlalchemy or sqlalchemy.orm
      is done, thereby avoiding any usage of __import__
      after the application starts new threads,
      fixes.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2197

      Fixed bug whereby the source clause
      used by query.join() would be inconsistent
      if against a column expression that combined
      multiple entities together.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2310

      fixed inappropriate evaluation of user-mapped
      object in a boolean context within query.get().

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2228

      Fixed bug apparent only in Python 3 whereby
      sorting of persistent + pending objects during
      flush would produce an illegal comparison,
      if the persistent object primary key
      is not a single integer.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2234

      Fixed bug where query.join() + aliased=True
      from a joined-inh structure to itself on
      relationship() with join condition on the child
      table would convert the lead entity into the
      joined one inappropriately.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2287

      Fixed bug whereby mapper.order_by attribute would
      be ignored in the "inner" query within a
      subquery eager load. .

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2215

      Fixed bug whereby if a mapped class
      redefined __hash__() or __eq__() to something
      non-standard, which is a supported use case
      as SQLA should never consult these,
      the methods would be consulted if the class
      was part of a "composite" (i.e. non-single-entity)
      result set.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2188

      Fixed subtle bug that caused SQL to blow
      up if: column_property() against subquery +
      joinedload + LIMIT + order by the column
      property() occurred. .

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2207

      The join condition produced by with_parent
      as well as when using a "dynamic" relationship
      against a parent will generate unique
      bindparams, rather than incorrectly repeating
      the same bindparam. .

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2199

      Repaired the "no statement condition"
      assertion in Query which would attempt
      to raise if a generative method were called
      after from_statement() were called..

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1776

      Cls.column.collate("some collation") now
      works.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2297

      Fixed the error formatting raised when
      a tuple is inadvertently passed to session.query().

    .. change::
        :tags: engine
        :tickets: 2317

      Backported the fix for introduced
      in 0.7.4, which ensures that the connection
      is in a valid state before attempting to call
      rollback()/prepare()/release() on savepoint
      and two-phase transactions.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2188

      Fixed two subtle bugs involving column
      correspondence in a selectable,
      one with the same labeled subquery repeated, the other
      when the label has been "grouped" and
      loses itself.  Affects.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 

      Fixed bug whereby "warn on unicode" flag
      would get set for the String type
      when used with certain dialects.  This
      bug is not in 0.7.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2270

      Fixed bug whereby with_only_columns() method of
      Select would fail if a selectable were passed..   However, the FROM behavior is
      still incorrect here, so you need 0.7 in
      any case for this use case to be usable.

    .. change::
        :tags: schema
        :tickets: 

      Added an informative error message when
      ForeignKeyConstraint refers to a column name in
      the parent that is not found.

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql
        :tickets: 2291, 2141

      Fixed bug related to whereby the
      same modified index behavior in PG 9 affected
      primary key reflection on a renamed column..

    .. change::
        :tags: mysql
        :tickets: 2186

      Fixed OurSQL dialect to use ansi-neutral
      quote symbol "'" for XA commands instead
      of '"'. .

    .. change::
        :tags: mysql
        :tickets: 2225

      a CREATE TABLE will put the COLLATE option
      after CHARSET, which appears to be part of
      MySQL's arbitrary rules regarding if it will actually
      work or not.

    .. change::
        :tags: mssql, bug
        :tickets: 2269

      Decode incoming values when retrieving
      list of index names and the names of columns
      within those indexes.

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle
        :tickets: 2200

      Added ORA-00028 to disconnect codes, use
      cx_oracle _Error.code to get at the code,.

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle
        :tickets: 2220

      repaired the oracle.RAW type which did not
      generate the correct DDL.

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle
        :tickets: 2212

      added CURRENT to reserved word list.

    .. change::
        :tags: examples
        :tickets: 2266

      Adjusted dictlike-polymorphic.py example
      to apply the CAST such that it works on
      PG, other databases.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.6.8
    :released: Sun Jun 05 2011

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2144

      Calling query.get() against a column-based entity is
      invalid, this condition now raises a deprecation warning.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2151

      a non_primary mapper will inherit the _identity_class
      of the primary mapper.  This so that a non_primary
      established against a class that's normally in an
      inheritance mapping will produce results that are
      identity-map compatible with that of the primary
      mapper

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2148

      Backported 0.7's identity map implementation, which
      does not use a mutex around removal.  This as some users
      were still getting deadlocks despite the adjustments
      in 0.6.7; the 0.7 approach that doesn't use a mutex
      does not appear to produce "dictionary changed size"
      issues, the original rationale for the mutex.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2163

      Fixed the error message emitted for "can't
      execute syncrule for destination column 'q';
      mapper 'X' does not map this column" to
      reference the correct mapper. .

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2149

      Fixed bug where determination of "self referential"
      relationship would fail with no workaround
      for joined-inh subclass related to itself,
      or joined-inh subclass related to a subclass
      of that with no cols in the sub-sub class
      in the join condition.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2153

      mapper() will ignore non-configured foreign keys
      to unrelated tables when determining inherit
      condition between parent and child class.
      This is equivalent to behavior already
      applied to declarative.  Note that 0.7 has a
      more comprehensive solution to this, altering
      how join() itself determines an FK error.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2171

      Fixed bug whereby mapper mapped to an anonymous
      alias would fail if logging were used, due to
      unescaped % sign in the alias name.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2170

      Modify the text of the message which occurs
      when the "identity" key isn't detected on
      flush, to include the common cause that
      the Column isn't set up to detect
      auto-increment correctly;.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2182

      Fixed bug where transaction-level "deleted"
      collection wouldn't be cleared of expunged
      states, raising an error if they later
      became transient.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2147

      Fixed bug whereby if FetchedValue was passed
      to column server_onupdate, it would not
      have its parent "column" assigned, added
      test coverage for all column default assignment
      patterns.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2167

      Fixed bug whereby nesting a label of a select()
      with another label in it would produce incorrect
      exported columns.   Among other things this would
      break an ORM column_property() mapping against
      another column_property(). .

    .. change::
        :tags: engine
        :tickets: 2178

      Adjusted the __contains__() method of
      a RowProxy result row such that no exception
      throw is generated internally;
      NoSuchColumnError() also will generate its
      message regardless of whether or not the column
      construct can be coerced to a string..

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql
        :tickets: 2141

      Fixed bug affecting PG 9 whereby index reflection
      would fail if against a column whose name
      had changed. .

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql
        :tickets: 2175

      Some unit test fixes regarding numeric arrays,
      MATCH operator.   A potential floating-point
      inaccuracy issue was fixed, and certain tests
      of the MATCH operator only execute within an
      EN-oriented locale for now. .

    .. change::
        :tags: mssql
        :tickets: 2169

      Fixed bug in MSSQL dialect whereby the aliasing
      applied to a schema-qualified table would leak
      into enclosing select statements.

    .. change::
        :tags: mssql
        :tickets: 2159

      Fixed bug whereby DATETIME2 type would fail on
      the "adapt" step when used in result sets or
      bound parameters.  This issue is not in 0.7.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.6.7
    :released: Wed Apr 13 2011

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2087

      Tightened the iterate vs. remove mutex around the
      identity map iteration, attempting to reduce the
      chance of an (extremely rare) reentrant gc operation
      causing a deadlock.  Might remove the mutex in
      0.7.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2030

      Added a `name` argument to `Query.subquery()`, to allow
      a fixed name to be assigned to the alias object.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2019

      A warning is emitted when a joined-table inheriting mapper
      has no primary keys on the locally mapped table
      (but has pks on the superclass table).

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2038

      Fixed bug where "middle" class in a polymorphic hierarchy
      would have no 'polymorphic_on' column if it didn't also
      specify a 'polymorphic_identity', leading to strange
      errors upon refresh, wrong class loaded when querying
      from that target. Also emits the correct WHERE criterion
      when using single table inheritance.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1995

      Fixed bug where a column with a SQL or server side default
      that was excluded from a mapping with include_properties
      or exclude_properties would result in UnmappedColumnError.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2046

      A warning is emitted in the unusual case that an
      append or similar event on a collection occurs after
      the parent object has been dereferenced, which
      prevents the parent from being marked as "dirty"
      in the session.  This will be an exception in 0.7.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2098

      Fixed bug in query.options() whereby a path
      applied to a lazyload using string keys could
      overlap a same named attribute on the wrong
      entity.  Note 0.7 has an updated version of this
      fix.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2063

      Reworded the exception raised when a flush
      is attempted of a subclass that is not polymorphic
      against the supertype.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2123

      Some fixes to the state handling regarding
      backrefs, typically when autoflush=False, where
      the back-referenced collection wouldn't
      properly handle add/removes with no net
      change.  Thanks to Richard Murri for the
      test case + patch.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2130

      a "having" clause would be copied from the
      inside to the outside query if from_self()
      were used..

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2028

      Column.copy(), as used in table.tometadata(), copies the
      'doc' attribute.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2023

      Added some defs to the resultproxy.c extension so that
      the extension compiles and runs on Python 2.4.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2042

      The compiler extension now supports overriding the default
      compilation of expression._BindParamClause including that
      the auto-generated binds within the VALUES/SET clause
      of an insert()/update() statement will also use the new
      compilation rules.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2089

      Added accessors to ResultProxy "returns_rows", "is_insert"

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 2116

      The limit/offset keywords to select() as well
      as the value passed to select.limit()/offset()
      will be coerced to integer.

    .. change::
        :tags: engine
        :tickets: 2102

      Fixed bug in QueuePool, SingletonThreadPool whereby
      connections that were discarded via overflow or periodic
      cleanup() were not explicitly closed, leaving garbage
      collection to the task instead.   This generally only
      affects non-reference-counting backends like Jython
      and Pypy.  Thanks to Jaimy Azle for spotting
      this.

    .. change::
        :tags: sqlite
        :tickets: 2115

      Fixed bug where reflection of foreign key
      created as "REFERENCES <tablename>" without
      col name would fail.

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql
        :tickets: 1083

      When explicit sequence execution derives the name
      of the auto-generated sequence of a SERIAL column,
      which currently only occurs if implicit_returning=False,
      now accommodates if the table + column name is greater
      than 63 characters using the same logic Postgresql uses.

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql
        :tickets: 2044

      Added an additional libpq message to the list of "disconnect"
      exceptions, "could not receive data from server"

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql
        :tickets: 2092

      Added RESERVED_WORDS for postgresql dialect.

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql
        :tickets: 2073

        :tickets: 2092

      Added RESERVED_WORDS informix dialect.

    .. change::
        :tags: mssql
        :tickets: 2071

      Rewrote the query used to get the definition of a view,
      typically when using the Inspector interface, to
      use sys.sql_modules instead of the information schema,
      thereby allowing views definitions longer than 4000
      characters to be fully returned.

    .. change::
        :tags: mysql
        :tickets: 2047

      oursql dialect accepts the same "ssl" arguments in
      create_engine() as that of MySQLdb.

    .. change::
        :tags: firebird
        :tickets: 2083

      The "implicit_returning" flag on create_engine() is
      honored if set to False.

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle
        :tickets: 2100

      Using column names that would require quotes
      for the column itself or for a name-generated
      bind parameter, such as names with special
      characters, underscores, non-ascii characters,
      now properly translate bind parameter keys when
      talking to cx_oracle.

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle
        :tickets: 2116

      Oracle dialect adds use_binds_for_limits=False
      create_engine() flag, will render the LIMIT/OFFSET
      values inline instead of as binds, reported to
      modify the execution plan used by Oracle.

    .. change::
        :tags: ext
        :tickets: 2090

      The horizontal_shard ShardedSession class accepts the common
      Session argument "query_cls" as a constructor argument,
      to enable further subclassing of ShardedQuery.

    .. change::
        :tags: declarative
        :tickets: 2050

      Added an explicit check for the case that the name
      'metadata' is used for a column attribute on a
      declarative class.

    .. change::
        :tags: declarative
        :tickets: 2061

      Fix error message referencing old @classproperty
      name to reference @declared_attr

    .. change::
        :tags: declarative
        :tickets: 2091

      Arguments in __mapper_args__ that aren't "hashable"
      aren't mistaken for always-hashable, possibly-column
      arguments.

    .. change::
        :tags: documentation
        :tickets: 2029

      Documented SQLite DATE/TIME/DATETIME types.

    .. change::
        :tags: examples
        :tickets: 2090

      The Beaker caching example allows a "query_cls" argument
      to the query_callable() function.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.6.6
    :released: Sat Jan 08 2011

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Fixed bug whereby a non-"mutable" attribute modified event
      which occurred on an object that was clean except for
      preceding mutable attribute changes would fail to strongly
      reference itself in the identity map. This would cause the
      object to be garbage collected, losing track of any changes
      that weren't previously saved in the "mutable changes"
      dictionary.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2013

      Fixed bug whereby "passive_deletes='all'" wasn't passing
      the correct symbols to lazy loaders during flush, thereby
      causing an unwarranted load.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1997

      Fixed bug which prevented composite mapped
      attributes from being used on a mapped select statement.. Note the workings of composite are slated to
      change significantly in 0.7.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1976

      active_history flag also added to composite().
      The flag has no effect in 0.6, but is instead
      a placeholder flag for forwards compatibility,
      as it applies in 0.7 for composites.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 2002

      Fixed uow bug whereby expired objects passed to
      Session.delete() would not have unloaded references
      or collections taken into account when deleting
      objects, despite passive_deletes remaining at
      its default of False.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1987

      A warning is emitted when version_id_col is specified
      on an inheriting mapper when the inherited mapper
      already has one, if those column expressions are not
      the same.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1954

      "innerjoin" flag doesn't take effect along the chain
      of joinedload() joins if a previous join in that chain
      is an outer join, thus allowing primary rows without
      a referenced child row to be correctly returned
      in results.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1964

      Fixed bug regarding "subqueryload" strategy whereby

      Added a new "lazyload" option "immediateload".
      Issues the usual "lazy" load operation automatically
      as the object is populated.   The use case
      here is when loading objects to be placed in
      an offline cache, or otherwise used after
      the session isn't available, and straight 'select'
      loading, not 'joined' or 'subquery', is desired.

      New Query methods: query.label(name), query.as_scalar(),
      return the query's statement as a scalar subquery
      with /without label;
      query.with_entities(\*ent), replaces the SELECT list of
      the query with new entities.
      Roughly equivalent to a generative form of query.values()

      expressions.

      Query.select_from() has been beefed up to help

      as the default "left" side, not the first entity

      The exception raised by Session when it is used
      subsequent to a subtransaction rollback (which is what
      happens when a flush fails in autocommit=False mode) has
      now been reworded (this is the "inactive due to a
      rollback in a subtransaction" message). In particular,
      if the rollback was due to an exception during flush(),
      the message states this is the case, and reiterates the
      string form of the original exception that occurred
      during flush. If the session is closed due to explicit
      usage of subtransactions (not very common), the message
      just states this is the case.

      The exception raised by Mapper when repeated requests to
      its initialization are made after initialization already
      failed no longer assumes the "hasattr" case, since
      there's other scenarios in which this message gets
      emitted, and the message also does not compound onto
      itself multiple times - you get the same message for
      each attempt at usage. The misnomer "compiles" is being
      traded out for "initialize".

      Fixed bug in query.update() where 'evaluate' or 'fetch'

      Added an assertion during flush which ensures
      that no NULL-holding identity keys were generated
      on "newly persistent" objects.
      This can occur when user defined code inadvertently

      lazy loads for relationship attributes now use
      the current state, not the "committed" state,
      of foreign and primary key attributes
      when issuing SQL, if a flush is not in process.
      Previously, only the database-committed state would
      be used.  In particular, this would cause a many-to-one
      get()-on-lazyload operation to fail, as autoflush
      is not triggered on these loads when the attributes are
      determined and the "committed" state may not be
      available.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 

      A new flag on relationship(), load_on_pending, allows
      the lazy loader to fire off on pending objects without a
      flush taking place, as well as a transient object that's
      been manually "attached" to the session. Note that this
      flag blocks attribute events from taking place when an
      object is loaded, so backrefs aren't available until
      after a flush. The flag is only intended for very
      specific use cases.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 

      Another new flag on relationship(), cascade_backrefs,
      disables the "save-update" cascade when the event was
      initiated on the "reverse" side of a bidirectional
      relationship.   This is a cleaner behavior so that
      many-to-ones can be set on a transient object without
      it getting sucked into the child object's session,
      while still allowing the forward collection to
      cascade.   We *might* default this to False in 0.7.

      Slight improvement to the behavior of

      the NoseSQLAlchemyPlugin has been moved to a
      new package "sqlalchemy_nose" which installs
      along with "sqlalchemy".  This so that the "nosetests"
      script works as always but also allows the
      --with-coverage option to turn on coverage before
      SQLAlchemy modules are imported, allowing coverage
      to work correctly.

      Added a mutex to the identity map which mutexes

      The Session class is now present in sqlalchemy.orm.*.
      We're moving away from the usage of create_session(),
      which has non-standard defaults, for those situations

      however.

      query.with_parent() now accepts transient objects

      The include_properties and exclude_properties arguments
      to mapper() now accept Column objects as members in
      addition to strings.  This so that same-named Column

      disambiguated.

      A warning is now emitted if a mapper is created against a
      join or other single selectable that includes multiple
      columns with the same name in its .c. collection,
      and those columns aren't explictly named as part of
      the same or separate attributes (or excluded).
      In 0.7 this warning will be an exception.   Note that
      this warning is not emitted when the combination occurs
      as a result of inheritance, so that attributes
      still allow being overridden naturally..  In 0.7 this will be improved further.

      The primary_key argument to mapper() can now specify
      a series of columns that are only a subset of
      the calculated "primary key" columns of the mapped
      selectable, without an error being raised.  This
      helps for situations where a selectable's effective
      primary key is simpler than the number of columns
      in the selectable that are actually marked as
      "primary_key", such as a join against two
      tables on their primary key columns.

      An object that's been deleted now gets a flag
      'deleted', which prohibits the object from
      being re-add()ed to the session, as previously
      the object would live in the identity map
      silently until its attributes were accessed.
      The make_transient() function now resets this
      flag along with the "key" flag.

      ignoring it.  Look for this to become an

      Another pass through the series of error messages
      emitted when relationship() is configured with
      ambiguous arguments.   The "foreign_keys"
      setting is no longer mentioned, as it is almost
      never needed and it is preferable users set up
      correct ForeignKey metadata, which is now the
      recommendation.  If 'foreign_keys'
      is used and is incorrect, the message suggests
      the attribute is probably unnecessary.  Docs
      for the attribute are beefed up.  This
      because all confused relationship() users on the
      ML appear to be attempting to use foreign_keys
      due to the message, which only confuses them
      further since Table metadata is much clearer.

    .. change::

      If the "secondary" table has no ForeignKey metadata
      and no foreign_keys is set, even though the
      user is passing screwed up information, it is assumed
      that primary/secondaryjoin expressions should
      consider only and all cols in "secondary" to be
      foreign.  It's not possible with "secondary" for
      the foreign keys to be elsewhere in any case.
      A warning is now emitted instead of an error,
      and the mapping succeeds.

      Moving an o2m object from one collection to
      another, or vice versa changing the referenced
      object by an m2o, where the foreign key is also a
      member of the primary key, will now be more
      carefully checked during flush if the change in
      value of the foreign key on the "many" side is the
      result of a change in the primary key of the "one"
      side, or if the "one" is just a different object.
      In one case, a cascade-capable DB would have
      cascaded the value already and we need to look at
      the "new" PK value to do an UPDATE, in the other we
      need to continue looking at the "old". We now look
      at the "old", assuming passive_updates=True,
      unless we know it was a PK switch that
      triggered the change.

      The value of version_id_col can be changed
      manually, and this will result in an UPDATE
      of the row.  Versioned UPDATEs and DELETEs
      now use the "committed" value of the
      version_id_col in the WHERE clause and
      not the pending changed value. The
      version generator is also bypassed if
      manual changes are present on the attribute.

      Repaired the usage of merge() when used with
      concrete inheriting mappers.  Such mappers frequently
      have so-called "concrete" attributes, which are
      subclass attributes that "disable" propagation from
      the parent - these needed to allow a merge()
      operation to pass through without effect.

      Specifying a non-column based argument
      for column_mapped_collection, including string,

      Similarly, for relationship(), foreign_keys,

      Changed the scheme used to generate truncated

      place with the auto-generated name, not one
      that is user-defined (an error would be
      raised instead), and the truncation scheme
      itself is now based on a fragment of an md5

      of the "detect primary key switch" flush handler.
      It now ignores objects that are no longer

      query.order_by() now accepts False, which cancels

      already existing feature of passing None, which
      suppresses any existing order_by() settings, including
      those configured on the mapper.  False will make it

      Added more aggressive caching to the mapper's usage of
      UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE expressions.  Assuming the
      statement has no per-object SQL expressions attached,
      the expression objects are cached by the mapper after
      the first create, and their compiled form is stored
      persistently in a cache dictionary for the duration of
      the related Engine.  The cache is an LRUCache for the
      rare case that a mapper receives an extremely

      Unit of work internals have been rewritten.  Units of work

      can now be flushed without recursion overflows
      as there is no longer reliance upon recursive calls.  The number of internal structures now stays
      constant for a particular session state, regardless of
      how many relationships are present on mappings.  The flow
      of events now corresponds to a linear list of steps,
      generated by the mappers and relationships based on actual
      work to be done, filtered through a single topological sort
      for correct ordering.  Flush actions are assembled using
      far fewer steps and less memory.

      Session.refresh() now does an equivalent expire()

      not affected in any way by the presence of "refresh-expire"
      cascade.   This is a change in behavior versus that
      of 0.6beta2, where the "lockmode" flag passed to refresh()
      would cause a version check to occur.  Since the instance
      is first expired, refresh() always upgrades the object
      to the most recent version.

      Major feature: Added new "subquery" loading capability to
      relationship().   This is an eager loading option which
      generates a second SELECT for each collection represented
      in a query, across all parents at once.  The query
      re-issues the original end-user query wrapped in a subquery,
      applies joins out to the target collection, and loads
      all those collections fully in one result, similar to
      "joined" eager loading but using all inner joins and not
      re-fetching full parent rows repeatedly (as most DBAPIs seem
      to do, even if columns are skipped).   Subquery loading is
      available at mapper config level using "lazy='subquery'" and
      at the query options level using "subqueryload(props..)",
      "subqueryload_all(props...)".

      To accomodate the fact that there are now two kinds of eager
      loading available, the new names for eagerload() and

      The "lazy" flag on the relationship() function now accepts
      a string argument for all kinds of loading: "select", "joined",
      "subquery", "noload" and "dynamic", where the default is now
      "select".  The old values of True/
      False/None still retain their usual meanings and will remain

      Some platforms will now interpret certain literal values

      In this model, bind parameters aren't allowed in the
      columns clause of a SELECT, nor are certain ambiguous
      expressions like "?=?".  When this mode is enabled, the base
      compiler will render the binds as inline literals, but only across
      strings and numeric values.  Other types such as dates
      will raise an error, unless the dialect subclass defines
      a literal rendering function for those.  The bind parameter
      must have an embedded literal value already or an error
      is raised (i.e. won't work with straight bindparam('x')).

      The type/expression system now does a more complete job
      of determining the return type from an expression
      as well as the adaptation of the Python operator into
      a SQL operator, based on the full left/right/operator
      of the given expression.  In particular
      the date/time/interval system created for Postgresql
      EXTRACT in has now been generalized into
      the type system.   The previous behavior which often
      occured of an expression "column + literal" forcing
      the type of "literal" to be the same as that of "column"
      will now usually not occur - the type of
      "literal" is first derived from the Python type of the
      literal, assuming standard native Python types + date
      types, before falling back to that of the known type
      on the other side of the expression.  If the
      "fallback" type is compatible (i.e. CHAR from String),
      the literal side will use that.  TypeDecorator
      types override this by default to coerce the "literal"
      side unconditionally, which can be changed by implementing
      the coerce_compared_value() method. Also part of.

      Made sqlalchemy.sql.expressions.Executable part of public
      API, used for any expression construct that can be sent to
      execute().  FunctionElement now inherits Executable so that
      it gains execution_options(), which are also propagated
      to the select() that's generated within execute().
      Executable in turn subclasses _Generative which marks
      any ClauseElement that supports the @_generative
      decorator - these may also become "public" for the benefit
      of the compiler extension at some point.

      A change to the solution for - an end-user
      defined bind parameter name that directly conflicts with
      a column-named bind generated directly from the SET or
      VALUES clause of an update/insert generates a compile error.
      This reduces call counts and eliminates some cases where
      undesirable name conflicts could still occur.

      the "scale" argument of the Numeric() type is honored when

      Added an optional C extension to speed up the sql layer by
      reimplementing RowProxy and the most common result processors.
      The actual speedups will depend heavily on your DBAPI and
      the mix of datatypes used in your tables, and can vary from
      a 30% improvement to more than 200%.  It also provides a modest
      (~15-20%) indirect improvement to ORM speed for large queries.
      Note that it is *not* built/installed by default.

      the execution sequence pulls all rowcount/last inserted ID
      info from the cursor before commit() is called on the

      Opened up logging a bit such that isEnabledFor() is called
      more often, so that changes to the log level for engine/pool
      will be reflected on next connect.   This adds a small
      amount of method call overhead.  It's negligible and will make
      life a lot easier for all those situations when logging
      just happens to be configured after create_engine() is called.

      The assert_unicode flag is deprecated.  SQLAlchemy will raise

      The visit_pool() method of Dialect is removed, and replaced with

      declarative now accepts mixin classes directly, as a means
      to provide common functional and column-based elements on
      all subclasses, as well as a means to propagate a fixed
      set of __table_args__ or __mapper_args__ to subclasses.
      For custom combinations of __table_args__/__mapper_args__ from
      an inherited mixin to local, descriptors can now be used.

      the __mapper_args__ dict is copied when propagating to a subclass,

      Oracle 'DATE' now does not perform any result processing,

      Changes to query.update() and query.delete():

          'fetch', thus matching that of query.delete().
          'expire' is deprecated and issues a warning.
      
        - query.update() and query.delete() both default to
          'evaluate' for the synchronize strategy.
      
        - the 'synchronize' strategy for update() and delete()
          raises an error on failure. There is no implicit fallback
          onto "fetch". Failure of evaluation is based on the
          structure of criteria, so success/failure is deterministic
          based on code structure.

      Enhancements on many-to-one relations:
        - many-to-one relations now fire off a lazyload in fewer
          cases, including in most cases will not fetch the "old"
          value when a new one is replaced.
      
        - many-to-one relation to a joined-table subclass now uses
          get() for a simple load (known as the "use_get"
          condition), i.e. Related->Sub(Base), without the need to
          redefine the primaryjoin condition in terms of the base
          table.
      
        - specifying a foreign key with a declarative column, i.e.
          ForeignKey(MyRelatedClass.id) doesn't break the "use_get"
          condition from taking place
      
        - relation(), eagerload(), and eagerload_all() now feature
          an option called "innerjoin". Specify `True` or `False` to
          control whether an eager join is constructed as an INNER
          or OUTER join. Default is `False` as always. The mapper
          options will override whichever setting is specified on
          relation(). Should generally be set for many-to-one, not
          nullable foreign key relations to allow improved join
          performance.
      
        - the behavior of eagerloading such that the main query is
          wrapped in a subquery when LIMIT/OFFSET are present now
          makes an exception for the case when all eager loads are
          many-to-one joins. In those cases, the eager joins are
          against the parent table directly along with the
          limit/offset without the extra overhead of a subquery,
          since a many-to-one join does not add rows to the result.

      Session.merge() is performance optimized, using half the

      merge() now also merges the "options" associated with a given
      state, i.e. those passed through query.options() which follow
      along with an instance, such as options to eagerly- or
      lazyily- load various attributes.   This is essential for
      the construction of highly integrated caching schemes.  This
      is a subtle behavioral change vs. 0.5.

      A bug was fixed regarding the serialization of the "loader

      Primary key values can now be changed on a joined-table inheritance

      flush() now detects when a primary key column was updated by
      an ON UPDATE CASCADE operation from another primary key, and
      can then locate the row for a subsequent UPDATE on the new PK
      value.  This occurs when a relation() is there to establish
      the relationship as well as passive_updates=True.

      the "save-update" cascade will now cascade the pending *removed*
      values from a scalar or collection attribute into the new session
      during an add() operation.  This so that the flush() operation
      will also delete or modify rows of those disconnected items.

      Using a "dynamic" loader with a "secondary" table now produces
      a query where the "secondary" table is *not* aliased.  This
      allows the secondary Table object to be used in the "order_by"
      attribute of the relation(), and also allows it to be used
      in filter criterion against the dynamic relation.

      relation() with uselist=False will emit a warning when
      an eager or lazy load locates more than one valid value for

      JOIN or for other conditions.

      query.from_self(), query.union(), others which do a
      "SELECT * from (SELECT...)" type of nesting will do
      a better job translating column expressions within the subquery
      to the columns clause of the outer query.  This is
      potentially backwards incompatible with 0.5, in that this
      may break queries with literal expressions that do not have labels
      applied (i.e. literal('foo'), etc.)

      the allow_null_pks flag on mapper() is deprecated, and
      the feature is turned "on" by default.  This means that
      a row which has a non-null value for any of its primary key
      columns will be considered an identity.  The need for this

      The internal BackRef() is gone and backref() returns a plain
      tuple that is understood by RelationProperty.

      an executemany() now requires that all bound parameter
      sets require that all keys are present which are
      present in the first bound parameter set.  The structure
      and behavior of an insert/update statement is very much
      determined by the first parameter set, including which
      defaults are going to fire off, and a minimum of
      guesswork is performed with all the rest so that performance
      is not impacted.  For this reason defaults would otherwise
      silently "fail" for missing parameters, so this is now guarded
      against.

      returning() support is native to insert(), update(),
      delete(). Implementations of varying levels of
      functionality exist for Postgresql, Firebird, MSSQL and
      Oracle. returning() can be called explicitly with column
      expressions which are then returned in the resultset,
      usually via fetchone() or first().
      
      insert() constructs will also use RETURNING implicitly to
      get newly generated primary key values, if the database
      version in use supports it (a version number check is
      performed). This occurs if no end-user returning() was
      specified.

      union(), intersect(), except() and other "compound" types
      of statements have more consistent behavior w.r.t.
      parenthesizing.   Each compound element embedded within
      another will now be grouped with parenthesis - previously,
      the first compound element in the list would not be grouped,
      as SQLite doesn't like a statement to start with
      parenthesis.   However, Postgresql in particular has
      precedence rules regarding INTERSECT, and it is
      more consistent for parenthesis to be applied equally
      to all sub-elements.   So now, the workaround for SQLite
      is also what the workaround for PG was previously -
      when nesting compound elements, the first one usually needs
      ".alias().select()" called on it to wrap it inside
      of a subquery.

      removed needless "counter" behavior with select()
      labelnames that match a column name in the table,

      "tablename_id_1" in an attempt to avoid naming
      conflicts, when the table has a column actually
      named "tablename_id" - this is because

      "functions" and "operators" dictionaries in compiler

       The "postgres" name remains for backwards compatiblity
       in the following ways:
      
           - There is a "postgres.py" dummy dialect which

             "databases" module, i.e. "from
             sqlalchemy.databases import postgres" as well as
             "dialects", "from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgres
             import base as pg", will send a deprecation
             warning.
      
           - Special expression arguments are now named
             "postgresql_returning" and "postgresql_where", but
             the older "postgres_returning" and

      The system by which types are expressed in SQL and DDL
      has been moved to the compiler system.  This has the
      effect that there are much fewer type objects within

      String/Text/Unicode types now skip the unicode() check
