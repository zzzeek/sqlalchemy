	:version: 1.0.0

    Version 1.0.0 is the first release of the 1.0 series.   Many changes
    described here are also present in the 0.9 and sometimes the 0.8
    series as well.  For changes that are specific to 1.0 with an emphasis
    on compatibility concerns, see :doc:`/changelog/migration_10`.

        A warning is emitted when the same polymorphic identity is assigned
        to two different mappers in the same hierarchy.  This is typically a
        user error and means that the two different mapping types cannot be
        correctly distinguished at load time.  Pull request courtesy
        Sebastian Bank.

        The type of expression is reported when an object passed to a
        SQL expression unit can't be interpreted as a SQL fragment;

        The primary :class:`.Mapper` of a :class:`.Query` is now passed to the
        :meth:`.Session.get_bind` method when calling upon
        :meth:`.Query.count`, :meth:`.Query.update`, :meth:`.Query.delete`,
        as well as queries against mapped columns,
        :obj:`.column_property` objects, and SQL functions and expressions
        derived from mapped columns.   This allows sessions that rely upon
        either customized :meth:`.Session.get_bind` schemes or "bound" metadata
        to work in all relevant cases.

        Custom dialects that implement :class:`.GenericTypeCompiler` can
        now be constructed such that the visit methods receive an indication
        of the owning expression object, if any.  Any visit method that
        accepts keyword arguments (e.g. ``**kw``) will in most cases
        receive a keyword argument ``type_expression``, referring to the
        expression object that the type is contained within.  For columns
        in DDL, the dialect's compiler class may need to alter its
        ``get_column_specification()`` method to support this as well.
        The ``UserDefinedType.get_col_spec()`` method will also receive
        ``type_expression`` if it provides ``**kw`` in its argument
        signature.

        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 3288

        The multi-values version of :meth:`.Insert.values` has been
        repaired to work more usefully with tables that have Python-
        side default values and/or functions, as well as server-side
        defaults. The feature will now work with a dialect that uses
        "positional" parameters; a Python callable will also be
        invoked individually for each row just as is the case with an
        "executemany" style invocation; a server- side default column
        will no longer implicitly receive the value explicitly
        specified for the first row, instead refusing to invoke
        without an explicit value.

        :tags: feature, general

        Structural memory use has been improved via much more significant use
        of ``__slots__`` for many internal objects.  This optimization is
        particularly geared towards the base memory size of large applications
        that have lots of tables and columns, and greatly reduces memory
        size for a variety of high-volume objects including event listening
        internals, comparator objects and parts of the ORM attribute and
        loader strategy system.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 3283

        The :class:`.mysql.SET` type has been overhauled to no longer
        assume that the empty string, or a set with a single empty string
        value, is in fact a set with a single empty string; instead, this
        is by default treated as the empty set.  In order to handle persistence
        of a :class:`.mysql.SET` that actually wants to include the blank
        value ``''`` as a legitimate value, a new bitwise operational mode
        is added which is enabled by the
        :paramref:`.mysql.SET.retrieve_as_bitwise` flag, which will persist
        and retrieve values unambiguously using their bitflag positioning.
        Storage and retrieval of unicode values for driver configurations
        that aren't converting unicode natively is also repaired.

        :tags: feature, schema
        :tickets: 3282

        The DDL generation system of :meth:`.MetaData.create_all`
        and :meth:`.MetaData.drop_all` has been enhanced to in most
        cases automatically handle the case of mutually dependent
        foreign key constraints; the need for the
        :paramref:`.ForeignKeyConstraint.use_alter` flag is greatly
        reduced.  The system also works for constraints which aren't given
        a name up front; only in the case of DROP is a name required for
        at least one of the constraints involved in the cycle.

        .. seealso::

            :ref:`feature_3282`

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, schema

        Added a new accessor :attr:`.Table.foreign_key_constraints`
        to complement the :attr:`.Table.foreign_keys` collection,
        as well as :attr:`.ForeignKeyConstraint.referred_table`.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sqlite
        :tickets: 3244, 3261

        UNIQUE and FOREIGN KEY constraints are now fully reflected on
        SQLite both with and without names.  Previously, foreign key
        names were ignored and unnamed unique constraints were skipped.
        Thanks to Jon Nelson for assistance with this.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, examples

        A new suite of examples dedicated to providing a detailed study
        into performance of SQLAlchemy ORM and Core, as well as the DBAPI,
        from multiple perspectives.  The suite runs within a container
        that provides built in profiling displays both through console
        output as well as graphically via the RunSnake tool.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm
        :tickets: 3100

        A new series of :class:`.Session` methods which provide hooks
        directly into the unit of work's facility for emitting INSERT
        and UPDATE statements has been created.  When used correctly,
        this expert-oriented system can allow ORM-mappings to be used
        to generate bulk insert and update statements batched into
        executemany groups, allowing the statements to proceed at
        speeds that rival direct use of the Core.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, mssql
        :tickets: 3039

        SQL Server 2012 now recommends VARCHAR(max), NVARCHAR(max),
        VARBINARY(max) for large text/binary types.  The MSSQL dialect will
        now respect this based on version detection, as well as the new
        ``deprecate_large_types`` flag.

            :ref:`mssql_large_type_deprecation`

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sqlite
        :tickets: 3257

        The SQLite dialect, when using the :class:`.sqlite.DATE`,
        :class:`.sqlite.TIME`,
        or :class:`.sqlite.DATETIME` types, and given a ``storage_format`` that
        only renders numbers, will render the types in DDL as
        ``DATE_CHAR``, ``TIME_CHAR``, and ``DATETIME_CHAR``, so that despite the
        lack of alpha characters in the values, the column will still
        deliver the "text affinity".  Normally this is not needed, as the
        textual values within the default storage formats already
        imply text.

        :tags: bug, engine
        :tickets: 3266

        The engine-level error handling and wrapping routines will now
        take effect in all engine connection use cases, including
        when user-custom connect routines are used via the
        :paramref:`.create_engine.creator` parameter, as well as when
        the :class:`.Connection` encounters a connection error on
        revalidation.

        New Oracle DDL features for tables, indexes: COMPRESS, BITMAP.
        Patch courtesy Gabor Gombas.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, oracle

        An alias name will be properly quoted when referred to using the
        ``%(name)s`` token inside the :meth:`.Select.with_hint` method.
        Previously, the Oracle backend hadn't implemented this quoting.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, oracle
        :tickets: 3220

        Added support for CTEs under Oracle.  This includes some tweaks
        to the aliasing syntax, as well as a new CTE feature
        :meth:`.CTE.suffix_with`, which is useful for adding in special
        Oracle-specific directives to the CTE.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, mysql
        :tickets: 3121

        Updated the "supports_unicode_statements" flag to True for MySQLdb
        and Pymysql under Python 2.   This refers to the SQL statements
        themselves, not the parameters, and affects issues such as table
        and column names using non-ASCII characters.   These drivers both
        appear to support Python 2 Unicode objects without issue in modern
        versions.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 3263

        The :meth:`.ColumnOperators.match` operator is now handled such that the
        return type is not strictly assumed to be boolean; it now
        returns a :class:`.Boolean` subclass called :class:`.MatchType`.
        The type will still produce boolean behavior when used in Python
        expressions, however the dialect can override its behavior at
        result time.  In the case of MySQL, while the MATCH operator
        is typically used in a boolean context within an expression,
        if one actually queries for the value of a match expression, a
        floating point value is returned; this value is not compatible
        with SQLAlchemy's C-based boolean processor, so MySQL's result-set
        behavior now follows that of the :class:`.Float` type.
        A new operator object ``notmatch_op`` is also added to better allow
        dialects to define the negation of a match operation.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, postgresql
        :tickets: 3264

        The :meth:`.PGDialect.has_table` method will now query against
        ``pg_catalog.pg_table_is_visible(c.oid)``, rather than testing
        for an exact schema match, when the schema name is None; this
        so that the method will also illustrate that temporary tables
        are present.  Note that this is a behavioral change, as Postgresql
        allows a non-temporary table to silently overwrite an existing
        temporary table of the same name, so this changes the behavior
        of ``checkfirst`` in that unusual scenario.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 3260

        Fixed bug in :meth:`.Table.tometadata` method where the
        :class:`.CheckConstraint` associated with a :class:`.Boolean`
        or :class:`.Enum` type object would be doubled in the target table.
        The copy process now tracks the production of this constraint object
        as local to a type object.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm
        :tickets: 3217

        Added a parameter :paramref:`.Query.join.isouter` which is synonymous
        with calling :meth:`.Query.outerjoin`; this flag is to provide a more
        consistent interface compared to Core :meth:`.FromClause.join`.

        The behavioral contract of the :attr:`.ForeignKeyConstraint.columns`
        collection has been made consistent; this attribute is now a
        :class:`.ColumnCollection` like that of all other constraints and
        is initialized at the point when the constraint is associated with
        a :class:`.Table`.

        The :meth:`.PropComparator.of_type` modifier has been
        improved in conjunction with loader directives such as
        :func:`.joinedload` and :func:`.contains_eager` such that if
        two :meth:`.PropComparator.of_type` modifiers of the same
        base type/path are encountered, they will be joined together
        into a single "polymorphic" entity, rather than replacing
        the entity of type A with the one of type B.  E.g.
        a joinedload of ``A.b.of_type(BSub1)->BSub1.c`` combined with
        joinedload of ``A.b.of_type(BSub2)->BSub2.c`` will create a
        single joinedload of ``A.b.of_type((BSub1, BSub2)) -> BSub1.c, BSub2.c``,
        without the need for the ``with_polymorphic`` to be explicit
        in the query.

        .. seealso::

            :ref:`eagerloading_polymorphic_subtypes` - contains an updated
            example illustrating the new format.

        The :attr:`.Column.key` attribute is now used as the source of
        anonymous bound parameter names within expressions, to match the
        existing use of this value as the key when rendered in an INSERT
        or UPDATE statement.   This allows :attr:`.Column.key` to be used
        as a "substitute" string to work around a difficult column name
        that doesn't translate well into a bound parameter name.   Note that
        the paramstyle is configurable on :func:`.create_engine` in any case,
        and most DBAPIs today support a named and positional style.

        Fixed the name of the :paramref:`.PoolEvents.reset.dbapi_connection`
        parameter as passed to this event; in particular this affects
        usage of the "named" argument style for this event.  Pull request

        Added a new parameter :paramref:`.Table.tometadata.name` to
        the :meth:`.Table.tometadata` method.  Similar to
        :paramref:`.Table.tometadata.schema`, this argument causes the newly
        copied :class:`.Table` to take on the new name instead of
        the existing one.  An interesting capability this adds is that of
        copying a :class:`.Table` object to the *same* :class:`.MetaData`
        target with a new name.  Pull request courtesy n.d. parker.

        Repaired support of the ``copy.deepcopy()`` call when used by the
        :class:`.orm.util.CascadeOptions` argument, which occurs
        if ``copy.deepcopy()`` is being used with :func:`.relationship`
        (not an officially supported use case).  Pull request courtesy

        Reversing a change that was made in 0.9, the "singleton" nature
        of the "constants" :func:`.null`, :func:`.true`, and :func:`.false`
        has been reverted.   These functions returning a "singleton" object
        had the effect that different instances would be treated as the
        same regardless of lexical use, which in particular would impact
        the rendering of the columns clause of a SELECT statement.

        A warning is emitted in the case of multiple relationships that
        ultimately will populate a foreign key column in conflict with
        another, where the relationships are attempting to copy values
        from different source columns.  This occurs in the case where
        composite foreign keys with overlapping columns are mapped to
        relationships that each refer to a different referenced column.
        A new documentation section illustrates the example as well as how
        to overcome the issue by specifying "foreign" columns specifically
        on a per-relationship basis.

        Exception messages have been spiffed up a bit.  The SQL statement

        error messages that weren't related to a statement.  The full
        module and classname for the DBAPI-level exception is displayed,
        making it clear that this is a wrapped DBAPI exception.  The

        The :meth:`.Query.update` method will now convert string key
        names in the given dictionary of values into mapped attribute names
        against the mapped class being updated.  Previously, string names
        were taken in directly and passed to the core update statement without
        any means to resolve against the mapped entity.  Support for synonyms
        and hybrid attributes as the subject attributes of

        Improvements to the mechanism used by :class:`.Session` to locate
        "binds" (e.g. engines to use), such engines can be associated with

        defaults if otherwise unspecified; the limitation where non-

        Fixed bug in single table inheritance where a chain of joins
        that included the same single inh entity more than once
        (normally this should raise an error) could, in some cases
        depending on what was being joined "from", implicitly alias the
        second case of the single inh entity, producing
        a query that "worked".   But as this implicit aliasing is not
        intended in the case of single table inheritance, it didn't
        really "work" fully and was very misleading, since it wouldn't
        always appear.

        now include the "single table criteria" in the ON clause even
        if the ON clause is otherwise hand-rolled; it is now added to the
        criteria using AND, the same way as if joining to a single-table
        target using relationship or similar.

        The :class:`.UniqueConstraint` construct is now included when
        reflecting a :class:`.Table` object, for databases where this
        is applicable.  In order to achieve this
        with sufficient accuracy, MySQL and Postgresql now contain features
        that correct for the duplication of indexes and unique constraints
        when reflecting tables, indexes, and constraints.
        In the case of MySQL, there is not actually a "unique constraint"
        concept independent of a "unique index", so for this backend
        :class:`.UniqueConstraint` continues to remain non-present for a
        reflected :class:`.Table`.  For Postgresql, the query used to
        detect indexes against ``pg_index`` has been improved to check for
        the same construct in ``pg_constraint``, and the implicitly
        constructed unique index is not included with a
        reflected :class:`.Table`.

        In both cases, the  :meth:`.Inspector.get_indexes` and the
        :meth:`.Inspector.get_unique_constraints` methods return both
        constructs individually, but include a new token
        ``duplicates_constraint`` in the case of Postgresql or
        ``duplicates_index`` in the case
        of MySQL to indicate when this condition is detected.

        Fixed bug where a "branched" connection, that is the kind you get
        when you call :meth:`.Connection.connect`, would not share invalidation
        status with the parent.  The architecture of branching has been tweaked

        all invalidation status and operations.

        The :class:`.declared_attr` construct has newly improved

        decorated function will now have access to the final column
        copies present on the local mixin when invoked, and will also
        be invoked exactly once for each mapped class, the returned result
        being memoized.   A new modifier :attr:`.declared_attr.cascading`

        ``cascade="all, delete-orphan"`` automatically on a one-to-many
        relationship/backref where the foreign key is detected as containing
        one or more non-nullable columns.  This argument is present in the
        keywords passed to :func:`.automap.generate_relationship` in this
        case and can still be overridden.  Additionally, if the
        :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint` specifies ``ondelete="CASCADE"``
        for a non-nullable or ``ondelete="SET NULL"`` for a nullable set
        of columns, the argument ``passive_deletes=True`` is also added to the
        relationship.  Note that not all backends support reflection of

        A major rework to the behavior of expression labels, most
        specifically when used with ColumnProperty constructs with
        custom SQL expressions and in conjunction with the "order by
        labels" logic first introduced in 0.9.  Fixes include that an
        ``order_by(Entity.some_col_prop)`` will now make use of "order by
        label" rules even if Entity has been subject to aliasing,
        either via inheritance rendering or via the use of the
        ``aliased()`` construct; rendering of the same column property
        multiple times with aliasing (e.g. ``query(Entity.some_prop,
        entity_alias.some_prop)``) will label each occurrence of the
        entity with a distinct label, and additionally "order by
        label" rules will work for both (e.g.
        ``order_by(Entity.some_prop, entity_alias.some_prop)``).
        Additional issues that could prevent the "order by label"
        logic from working in 0.9, most notably that the state of a
        Label could change such that "order by label" would stop
        working depending on how things were called, has been fixed.

        MySQL boolean symbols "true", "false" work again.  0.9's change
        in :ticket:`2682` disallowed the MySQL dialect from making use of the
        "true" and "false" symbols in the context of "IS" / "IS NOT", but
        MySQL supports this syntax even though it has no boolean type.
        MySQL remains "non native boolean", but the :func:`.true`
        and :func:`.false` symbols again produce the
        keywords "true" and "false", so that an expression like
        ``column.is_(true())`` again works on MySQL.

        The hostname-based connection format for SQL Server when using
        pyodbc will no longer specify a default "driver name", and a warning
        is emitted if this is missing.  The optimal driver name for SQL Server
        changes frequently and is per-platform, so hostname based connections
        need to specify this.  DSN-based connections are preferred.

        The implicit conversion of strings to :func:`.text` constructs
        when passed to most builder methods of :func:`.select` as
        well as :class:`.Query` now emits a warning with just the
        plain string sent.   The textual conversion still proceeds normally,
        however.  The only method that accepts a string without a warning
        are the "label reference" methods like order_by(), group_by();
        these functions will now at compile time attempt to resolve a single
        string argument to a column or label expression present in the
        selectable; if none is located, the expression still renders, but
        you get the warning again. The rationale here is that the implicit
        conversion from string to text is more unexpected than not these days,
        and it is better that the user send more direction to the Core / ORM
        when passing a raw string as to what direction should be taken.
        Core/ORM tutorials have been updated to go more in depth as to how text
        is handled.

        subquery eager loading, or joined eager loading with collections,
        would take place.  These loading strategies are
        not currently compatible with yield_per, so by raising this error,

        Made a small adjustment to the mechanics of lazy loading,
        such that it has less chance of interfering with a joinload() in the
        very rare circumstance that an object points to itself; in this
        scenario, the object refers to itself while loading its attributes
        which can cause a mixup between loaders.   The use case of
        "object points to itself" is not fully supported, but the fix also

        Using :meth:`.Insert.from_select`  now implies ``inline=True``
        on :func:`.insert`.  This helps to fix a bug where an
        INSERT...FROM SELECT construct would inadvertently be compiled
        as "implicit returning" on supporting backends, which would
        cause breakage in the case of an INSERT that inserts zero rows
        (as implicit returning expects a row), as well as arbitrary
        return data in the case of an INSERT that inserts multiple
        rows (e.g. only the first row of many).
        A similar change is also applied to an INSERT..VALUES
        with multiple parameter sets; implicit RETURNING will no longer emit
        for this statement either.  As both of these constructs deal
        with varible numbers of rows, the
        :attr:`.ResultProxy.inserted_primary_key` accessor does not
        apply.   Previously, there was a documentation note that one
        may prefer ``inline=True`` with INSERT..FROM SELECT as some databases
        don't support returning and therefore can't do "implicit" returning,
        but there's no reason an INSERT...FROM SELECT needs implicit returning
        in any case.   Regular explicit :meth:`.Insert.returning` should
        be used to return variable numbers of result rows if inserted
        data is needed.

        Adjustment to attribute mechanics concerning when a value is
        implicitly initialized to None via first access; this action,
        which has always resulted in a population of the attribute,
        no longer does so; the None value is returned but the underlying
        attribute receives no set event.  This is consistent with how collections
        work and allows attribute mechanics to behave more consistently;
        in particular, getting an attribute with no value does not squash
        the event that should proceed if the value is actually set to None.

		:tags: feature, sql
		:tickets: 3034

		The :meth:`.Select.limit` and :meth:`.Select.offset` methods
		now accept any SQL expression, in addition to integer values, as
		arguments.  Typically this is used to allow a bound parameter to be
		passed, which can be substituted with a value later thus allowing
		Python-side caching of the SQL query.   The implementation
		here is fully backwards compatible with existing third party dialects,
		however those dialects which implement special LIMIT/OFFSET systems
		will need modification in order to take advantage of the new
		capabilities.  Limit and offset also support "literal_binds" mode,
        where bound parameters are rendered inline as strings based on
        a compile-time option.
        Work on this feature is courtesy of Dobes Vandermeer.
