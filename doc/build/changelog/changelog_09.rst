    :version: 0.9.0

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql

        Improved support for the cymysql driver, supporting version 0.6.5,
        courtesy Hajime Nakagami.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, examples

        Added "autoincrement=False" to the history table created in the
        versioning example, as this table shouldn't have autoinc on it
        in any case, courtesy Patrick Schmid.  Also in 0.8.3.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql

        The :meth:`.Operators.notin_` operator added in 0.8 now properly
        produces the negation of the expression "IN" returns
        when used against an empty collection.  Also in 0.8.3.

    .. change::
        :tags: general

        A large refactoring of packages has reorganized
        the import structure of many Core modules as well as some aspects
        of the ORM modules.  In particular ``sqlalchemy.sql`` has been broken
        out into several more modules than before so that the very large size
        of ``sqlalchemy.sql.expression`` is now pared down.   The effort
        has focused on a large reduction in import cycles.   Additionally,
        the system of API functions in ``sqlalchemy.sql.expression`` and
        ``sqlalchemy.orm`` has been reorganized to eliminate redundancy
        in documentation between the functions vs. the objects they produce.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature, orm

        Added a new attribute :attr:`.Session.info` to :class:`.Session`;
        this is a dictionary where applications can store arbitrary
        data local to a :class:`.Session`.
        The contents of :attr:`.Session.info` can be also be initialized
        using the ``info`` argument of :class:`.Session` or
        :class:`.sessionmaker`.

    .. change::
        :tags: mysql, bug
        :tickets: 2791

        Updates to MySQL reserved words for versions 5.5, 5.6, courtesy
        Hanno Schlichting.  Also in 0.8.3, 0.7.11.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, bug, cte
        :tickets: 2783

        Fixed bug in common table expression system where if the CTE were
        used only as an ``alias()`` construct, it would not render using the
        WITH keyword.  Also in 0.8.3, 0.7.11.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, general, py3k
        :tickets: 2161

        The C extensions are ported to Python 3 and will build under
        any supported CPython 2 or 3 environment.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm
        :tickets: 2268

        Removal of event listeners is now implemented.    The feature is
        provided via the :func:`.event.remove` function.

        .. seealso::

            :ref:`feature_2268`

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, examples

        Improved the examples in ``examples/generic_associations``, including
        that ``discriminator_on_association.py`` makes use of single table
        inheritance do the work with the "discriminator".  Also
        added a true "generic foreign key" example, which works similarly
        to other popular frameworks in that it uses an open-ended integer
        to point to any other table, foregoing traditional referential
        integrity.  While we don't recommend this pattern, information wants
        to be free.  Also in 0.8.3.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm, declarative

        Added a convenience class decorator :func:`.as_declarative`, is
        a wrapper for :func:`.declarative_base` which allows an existing base
        class to be applied using a nifty class-decorated approach.  Also
        in 0.8.3.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2786

        Fixed bug in ORM-level event registration where the "raw" or
        "propagate" flags could potentially be mis-configured in some
        "unmapped base class" configurations.  Also in 0.8.3.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2784

        Fixed bug in :class:`.CheckConstraint` DDL where the "quote" flag from a
        :class:`.Column` object would not be propagated.  Also in 0.8.3, 0.7.11.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2778

        A performance fix related to the usage of the :func:`.defer` option
        when loading mapped entities.   The function overhead of applying
        a per-object deferred callable to an instance at load time was
        significantly higher than that of just loading the data from the row
        (note that ``defer()`` is meant to reduce DB/network overhead, not
        necessarily function call count); the function call overhead is now
        less than that of loading data from the column in all cases.  There
        is also a reduction in the number of "lazy callable" objects created
        per load from N (total deferred values in the result) to 1 (total
        number of deferred cols).  Also in 0.8.3.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sqlite
        :tickets: 2781

        The newly added SQLite DATETIME arguments storage_format and
        regexp apparently were not fully implemented correctly; while the
        arguments were accepted, in practice they would have no effect;
        this has been fixed.  Also in 0.8.3.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql, postgresql
        :tickets: 2780

        Fixed bug where the expression system relied upon the ``str()``
        form of a some expressions when referring to the ``.c`` collection
        on a ``select()`` construct, but the ``str()`` form isn't available
        since the element relies on dialect-specific compilation constructs,
        notably the ``__getitem__()`` operator as used with a Postgresql
        ``ARRAY`` element.  The fix also adds a new exception class
        :class:`.UnsupportedCompilationError` which is raised in those cases
        where a compiler is asked to compile something it doesn't know
        how to.  Also in 0.8.3.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, engine, oracle
        :tickets: 2776

        Dialect.initialize() is not called a second time if an :class:`.Engine`
        is recreated, due to a disconnect error.   This fixes a particular
        issue in the Oracle 8 dialect, but in general the dialect.initialize()
        phase should only be once per dialect.  Also in 0.8.3.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm
        :tickets: 2789

        The mechanism by which attribute events pass along an
        :class:`.AttributeImpl` as an "initiator" token has been changed;
        the object is now an event-specific object called :class:`.attributes.Event`.
        Additionally, the attribute system no longer halts events based
        on a matching "initiator" token; this logic has been moved to be
        specific to ORM backref event handlers, which are the typical source
        of the re-propagation of an attribute event onto subsequent append/set/remove
        operations.  End user code which emulates the behavior of backrefs
        must now ensure that recursive event propagation schemes are halted,
        if the scheme does not use the backref handlers.   Using this new system,
        backref handlers can now peform a
        "two-hop" operation when an object is appended to a collection,
        associated with a new many-to-one, de-associated with the previous
        many-to-one, and then removed from a previous collection.   Before this
        change, the last step of removal from the previous collection would
        not occur.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, sql
        :tickets: 722

        Added new method to the :func:`.insert` construct
        :meth:`.Insert.from_select`.  Given a list of columns and
        a selectable, renders ``INSERT INTO (table) (columns) SELECT ..``.
        While this feature is highlighted as part of 0.9 it is also
        backported to 0.8.3.

        .. seealso::

            :ref:`feature_722`

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, sql

        The :func:`.update`, :func:`.insert`, and :func:`.delete` constructs
        will now interpret ORM entities as target tables to be operated upon,
        e.g.::

            from sqlalchemy import insert, update, delete

            ins = insert(SomeMappedClass).values(x=5)

            del_ = delete(SomeMappedClass).where(SomeMappedClass.id == 5)

            upd = update(SomeMappedClass).where(SomeMappedClass.id == 5).values(name='ed')

        Also in 0.8.3.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2773

        Fixed bug whereby attribute history functions would fail
        when an object we moved from "persistent" to "pending"
        using the :func:`.make_transient` function, for operations
        involving collection-based backrefs.  Also in 0.8.3.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, engine, pool
        :tickets: 2772

        Fixed bug where :class:`.QueuePool` would lose the correct
        checked out count if an existing pooled connection failed to reconnect
        after an invalidate or recycle event.  Also in 0.8.3.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 2768

        Fixed bug when using multi-table UPDATE where a supplemental
        table is a SELECT with its own bound parameters, where the positioning
        of the bound parameters would be reversed versus the statement
        itself when using MySQL's special syntax.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sqlite
        :tickets: 2764

        Added :class:`.BIGINT` to the list of type names that can be
        reflected by the SQLite dialect; courtesy Russell Stuart.
        Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm, declarative
        :tickets: 2761

        ORM descriptors such as hybrid properties can now be referenced
        by name in a string argument used with ``order_by``,
        ``primaryjoin``, or similar in :func:`.relationship`,
        in addition to column-bound attributes.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, engine
        :tickets: 2770

        New events added to :class:`.ConnectionEvents`:

        * :meth:`.ConnectionEvents.engine_connect`
        * :meth:`.ConnectionEvents.set_connection_execution_options`
        * :meth:`.ConnectionEvents.set_engine_execution_options`

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, firebird
        :tickets: 2763

        Added new flag ``retaining=False`` to the kinterbasdb and fdb dialects.
        This controls the value of the ``retaining`` flag sent to the
        ``commit()`` and ``rollback()`` methods of the DBAPI connection.
        Defaults to False.  Also in 0.8.2, where it defaults to True.

    .. change::
        :tags: requirements

        The Python `mock <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock>`_ library
        is now required in order to run the unit test suite.  While part
        of the standard library as of Python 3.3, previous Python installations
        will need to install this in order to run unit tests or to
        use the ``sqlalchemy.testing`` package for external dialects.
        This applies to 0.8.2 as well.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2750

        A warning is emitted when trying to flush an object of an inherited
        mapped class where the polymorphic discriminator has been assigned
        to a value that is invalid for the class.   Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, postgresql
        :tickets: 2740

        The behavior of :func:`.extract` has been simplified on the
        Postgresql dialect to no longer inject a hardcoded ``::timestamp``
        or similar cast into the given expression, as this interfered
        with types such as timezone-aware datetimes, but also
        does not appear to be at all necessary with modern versions
        of psycopg2.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, firebird
        :tickets: 2757

        Type lookup when reflecting the Firebird types LONG and
        INT64 has been fixed so that LONG is treated as INTEGER,
        INT64 treated as BIGINT, unless the type has a "precision"
        in which case it's treated as NUMERIC.  Patch courtesy
        Russell Stuart.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, postgresql
        :tickets: 2766

        Fixed bug in HSTORE type where keys/values that contained
        backslashed quotes would not be escaped correctly when
        using the "non native" (i.e. non-psycopg2) means
        of translating HSTORE data.  Patch courtesy Ryan Kelly.
        Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, postgresql
        :tickets: 2767

        Fixed bug where the order of columns in a multi-column
        Postgresql index would be reflected in the wrong order.
        Courtesy Roman Podolyaka.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2746, 2668

        Multiple fixes to the correlation behavior of
        :class:`.Select` constructs, first introduced in 0.8.0:

        * To satisfy the use case where FROM entries should be
          correlated outwards to a SELECT that encloses another,
          which then encloses this one, correlation now works
          across multiple levels when explicit correlation is
          established via :meth:`.Select.correlate`, provided
          that the target select is somewhere along the chain
          contained by a WHERE/ORDER BY/columns clause, not
          just nested FROM clauses. This makes
          :meth:`.Select.correlate` act more compatibly to
          that of 0.7 again while still maintaining the new
          "smart" correlation.

        * When explicit correlation is not used, the usual
          "implicit" correlation limits its behavior to just
          the immediate enclosing SELECT, to maximize compatibility
          with 0.7 applications, and also prevents correlation
          across nested FROMs in this case, maintaining compatibility
          with 0.8.0/0.8.1.

        * The :meth:`.Select.correlate_except` method was not
          preventing the given FROM clauses from correlation in
          all cases, and also would cause FROM clauses to be incorrectly
          omitted entirely (more like what 0.7 would do),
          this has been fixed.

        * Calling `select.correlate_except(None)` will enter
          all FROM clauses into correlation as would be expected.

        Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, ext

        Fixed bug whereby if a composite type were set up
        with a function instead of a class, the mutable extension
        would trip up when it tried to check that column
        for being a :class:`.MutableComposite` (which it isn't).
        Courtesy asldevi.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 1765

        The resolution of :class:`.ForeignKey` objects to their
        target :class:`.Column` has been reworked to be as
        immediate as possible, based on the moment that the
        target :class:`.Column` is associated with the same
        :class:`.MetaData` as this :class:`.ForeignKey`, rather
        than waiting for the first time a join is constructed,
        or similar. This along with other improvements allows
        earlier detection of some foreign key configuration
        issues.  Also included here is a rework of the
        type-propagation system, so that
        it should be reliable now to set the type as ``None``
        on any :class:`.Column` that refers to another via
        :class:`.ForeignKey` - the type will be copied from the
        target column as soon as that other column is associated,
        and now works for composite foreign keys as well.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, sql
        :tickets: 2744, 2734

        Provided a new attribute for :class:`.TypeDecorator`
        called :attr:`.TypeDecorator.coerce_to_is_types`,
        to make it easier to control how comparisons using
        ``==`` or ``!=`` to ``None`` and boolean types goes
        about producing an ``IS`` expression, or a plain
        equality expression with a bound parameter.


    .. change::
        :tags: feature, postgresql

        Support for Postgresql 9.2 range types has been added.
        Currently, no type translation is provided, so works
        directly with strings or psycopg2 2.5 range extension types
        at the moment.  Patch courtesy Chris Withers.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, examples

        Fixed an issue with the "versioning" recipe whereby a many-to-one
        reference could produce a meaningless version for the target,
        even though it was not changed, when backrefs were present.
        Patch courtesy Matt Chisholm.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, postgresql
        :tickets: 2072

        Added support for "AUTOCOMMIT" isolation when using the psycopg2
        DBAPI.   The keyword is available via the ``isolation_level``
        execution option.  Patch courtesy Roman Podolyaka.
        Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2759

        Fixed bug in polymorphic SQL generation where multiple joined-inheritance
        entities against the same base class joined to each other as well
        would not track columns on the base table independently of each other if
        the string of joins were more than two entities long.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::

        Fixed bug where the ``reset_on_return`` argument to various :class:`.Pool`
        implementations would not be propagated when the pool was regenerated.
        Courtesy Eevee.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2754

        Fixed bug where sending a composite attribute into :meth:`.Query.order_by`
        would produce a parenthesized expression not accepted by some databases.
        Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2755

        Fixed the interaction between composite attributes and
        the :func:`.aliased` function.  Previously, composite attributes
        wouldn't work correctly in comparison operations when aliasing
        was applied.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, sql
        :tickets: 1443

        Added support for "unique constraint" reflection, via the
        :meth:`.Inspector.get_unique_constraints` method.
        Thanks for Roman Podolyaka for the patch.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, pool
        :tickets: 2752

        Added pool logging for "rollback-on-return" and the less used
        "commit-on-return".  This is enabled with the rest of pool
        "debug" logging.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 2715

        Added another conditional to the ``mysql+gaerdbms`` dialect to
        detect so-called "development" mode, where we should use the
        ``rdbms_mysqldb`` DBAPI.  Patch courtesy Brett Slatkin.
        Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, mysql
        :tickets: 2704

        The ``mysql_length`` parameter used with :class:`.Index` can now
        be passed as a dictionary of column names/lengths, for use
        with composite indexes.  Big thanks to Roman Podolyaka for the
        patch.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, associationproxy
        :tickets: 2751

        Added additional criterion to the ==, != comparators, used with
        scalar values, for comparisons to None to also take into account
        the association record itself being non-present, in addition to the
        existing test for the scalar endpoint on the association record
        being NULL.  Previously, comparing ``Cls.scalar == None`` would return
        records for which ``Cls.associated`` were present and
        ``Cls.associated.scalar`` is None, but not rows for which
        ``Cls.associated`` is non-present.  More significantly, the
        inverse operation ``Cls.scalar != None`` *would* return ``Cls``
        rows for which ``Cls.associated`` was non-present.

        The case for ``Cls.scalar != 'somevalue'`` is also modified
        to act more like a direct SQL comparison; only rows for
        which ``Cls.associated`` is present and ``Associated.scalar``
        is non-NULL and not equal to ``'somevalue'`` are returned.
        Previously, this would be a simple ``NOT EXISTS``.

        Also added a special use case where you
        can call ``Cls.scalar.has()`` with no arguments,
        when ``Cls.scalar`` is a column-based value - this returns whether or
        not ``Cls.associated`` has any rows present, regardless of whether
        or not ``Cls.associated.scalar`` is NULL or not.

        A major change regarding how the ORM constructs joins where
        the right side is itself a join or left outer join.   The ORM
        is now configured to allow simple nesting of joins of
        the form ``a JOIN (b JOIN c ON b.id=c.id) ON a.id=b.id``,
        rather than forcing the right side into a ``SELECT`` subquery.
        This should allow significant performance improvements on most
        backends, most particularly MySQL.   The one database backend
        that has for many years held back this change, SQLite, is now addressed by
        moving the production of the ``SELECT`` subquery from the
        ORM to the SQL compiler; so that a right-nested join on SQLite will still
        ultimately render with a ``SELECT``, while all other backends
        are no longer impacted by this workaround.

        As part of this change, a new argument ``flat=True`` has been added
        to the :func:`.orm.aliased`, :meth:`.Join.alias`, and
        :func:`.orm.with_polymorphic` functions, which allows an "alias" of a
        JOIN to be produced which applies an anonymous alias to each component
        table within the join, rather than producing a subquery.

        :tickets: 2369

        Fixed an obscure bug where the wrong results would be
        fetched when joining/joinedloading across a many-to-many
        relationship to a single-table-inheriting
        subclass with a specific discriminator value, due to "secondary"
        rows that would come back.  The "secondary" and right-side
        tables are now inner joined inside of parenthesis for all
        ORM joins on many-to-many relationships so that the left->right
        join can accurately filtered.  This change was made possible
        by finally addressing the issue with right-nested joins
        outlined in :ticket:`2587`.

        Fixes to MSSQL with Python 3 + pyodbc, including that statements
        are passed correctly.

        When querying the information schema on SQL Server 2000, removed
        a CAST call that was added in 0.8.1 to help with driver issues,
        which apparently is not compatible on 2000.
        The CAST remains in place for SQL Server 2005 and greater.
        Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 2721

        The ``deferrable`` keyword argument on :class:`.ForeignKey` and
        :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint` will not render the ``DEFERRABLE`` keyword
        on the MySQL dialect.  For a long time we left this in place because
        a non-deferrable foreign key would act very differently than a deferrable
        one, but some environments just disable FKs on MySQL, so we'll be less
        opinionated here.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, ext, orm
        :tickets: 2730

        Fixed bug where :class:`.MutableDict` didn't report a change event
        when ``clear()`` was called.  Also in 0.8.2

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2738

        Fixed bug whereby joining a select() of a table "A" with multiple
        foreign key paths to a table "B", to that table "B", would fail
        to produce the "ambiguous join condition" error that would be
        reported if you join table "A" directly to "B"; it would instead
        produce a join condition with multiple criteria.  Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql, reflection
        :tickets: 2728

        Fixed bug whereby using :meth:`.MetaData.reflect` across a remote
        schema as well as a local schema could produce wrong results
        in the case where both schemas had a table of the same name.
        Also in 0.8.2.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2726

        Removed the "not implemented" ``__iter__()`` call from the base
        :class:`.ColumnOperators` class, while this was introduced
        in 0.8.0 to prevent an endless, memory-growing loop when one also
        implements a ``__getitem__()`` method on a custom
        operator and then calls erroneously ``list()`` on that object,
        it had the effect of causing column elements to report that they
        were in fact iterable types which then throw an error when you try
        to iterate.   There's no real way to have both sides here so we
        stick with Python best practices.  Careful with implementing
        ``__getitem__()`` on your custom operators! Also in 0.8.2.

        A :class:`.Label` construct will now render as its name alone
        in an ``ORDER BY`` clause, if that label is also referred to
        in the columns clause of the select, instead of rewriting the
        full expression.  This gives the database a better chance to
        optimize the evaulation of the same expression in two different
        contexts.

        The ``fdb`` dialect is now the default dialect when
        specified without a dialect qualifier, i.e. ``firebird://``,
        per the Firebird project publishing ``fdb`` as their
        official Python driver.

        The codebase is now "in-place" for Python
        2 and 3, the need to run 2to3 has been removed.
        Compatibility is now against Python 2.6 on forward.

    .. change::

    	The Oracle unit tests with cx_oracle now pass
    	fully under Python 3.

        The "auto-aliasing" behavior of the :class:`.Query.select_from`
        method has been turned off.  The specific behavior is now
        availble via a new method :class:`.Query.select_entity_from`.
        The auto-aliasing behavior here was never well documented and
        is generally not what's desired, as :class:`.Query.select_from`
        has become more oriented towards controlling how a JOIN is
        rendered.  :class:`.Query.select_entity_from` will also be made
        available in 0.8 so that applications which rely on the auto-aliasing
        can shift their applications to use this method.
