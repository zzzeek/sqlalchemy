    :version: 0.9.2

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2918

        Fixed an 0.9 regression where the automatic aliasing applied by
        :class:`.Query` and in other situations where selects or joins
        were aliased (such as joined table inheritance) could fail if a
        user-defined :class:`.Column` subclass were used in the expression.
        In this case, the subclass would fail to propagate ORM-specific
        "annotations" along needed by the adaptation.  The "expression
        annotations" system has been corrected to account for this case.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm

        Support is improved for supplying a :func:`.join` construct as the
        target of :paramref:`.relationship.secondary` for the purposes
        of creating very complex :func:`.relationship` join conditions.
        The change includes adjustments to query joining, joined eager loading
        to not render a SELECT subquery, changes to lazy loading such that
        the "secondary" target is properly included in the SELECT, and
        changes to declarative to better support specification of a
        join() object with classes as targets.

        The new use case is somewhat experimental, but a new documentation section
        has been added.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql, sql
        :tickets: 2917

        Added new test coverage for so-called "down adaptions" of SQL types,
        where a more specific type is adapted to a more generic one - this
        use case is needed by some third party tools such as ``sqlacodegen``.
        The specific cases that needed repair within this test suite were that
        of :class:`.mysql.ENUM` being downcast into a :class:`.types.Enum`,
        and that of SQLite date types being cast into generic date types.
        The ``adapt()`` method needed to become more specific here to counteract
        the removal of a "catch all" ``**kwargs`` collection on the base
        :class:`.TypeEngine` class that was removed in 0.9.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, sql
        :tickets: 2910

        Options can now be specified on a :class:`.PrimaryKeyConstraint` object
        independently of the specification of columns in the table with
        the ``primary_key=True`` flag; use a :class:`.PrimaryKeyConstraint`
        object with no columns in it to achieve this result.

        Previously, an explicit :class:`.PrimaryKeyConstraint` would have the
        effect of those columns marked as ``primary_key=True`` being ignored;
        since this is no longer the case, the :class:`.PrimaryKeyConstraint`
        will now assert that either one style or the other is used to specify
        the columns, or if both are present, that the column lists match
        exactly.  If an inconsistent set of columns in the
        :class:`.PrimaryKeyConstraint`
        and within the :class:`.Table` marked as ``primary_key=True`` are
        present, a warning is emitted, and the list of columns is taken
        only from the :class:`.PrimaryKeyConstraint` alone as was the case
        in previous releases.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, sql
        :tickets: 2866

        The system by which schema constructs and certain SQL constructs
        accept dialect-specific keyword arguments has been enhanced.  This
        system includes commonly the :class:`.Table` and :class:`.Index` constructs,
        which accept a wide variety of dialect-specific arguments such as
        ``mysql_engine`` and ``postgresql_where``, as well as the constructs
        :class:`.PrimaryKeyConstraint`, :class:`.UniqueConstraint`,
        :class:`.Update`, :class:`.Insert` and :class:`.Delete`, and also
        newly added kwarg capability to :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint`
        and :class:`.ForeignKey`.  The change is that participating dialects
        can now specify acceptable argument lists for these constructs, allowing
        an argument error to be raised if an invalid keyword is specified for
        a particular dialect.  If the dialect portion of the keyword is unrecognized,
        a warning is emitted only; while the system will actually make use
        of setuptools entrypoints in order to locate non-local dialects,
        the use case where certain dialect-specific arguments are used
        in an environment where that third-party dialect is uninstalled remains
        supported.  Dialects also have to explicitly opt-in to this system,
        so that external dialects which aren't making use of this system
        will remain unaffected.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :pullreq: bitbucket:11

        A :class:`.UniqueConstraint` created inline with a :class:`.Table`
        that has no columns within it will be skipped.  Pullreq courtesy
        Derek Harland.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, mssql
        :pullreq: bitbucket:11

        Added an option ``mssql_clustered`` to the :class:`.UniqueConstraint`
        and :class:`.PrimaryKeyConstraint` constructs; on SQL Server, this adds
        the ``CLUSTERED`` keyword to the constraint construct within DDL.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql, orm
        :tickets: 2912

        Fixed the multiple-table "UPDATE..FROM" construct, only usable on
        MySQL, to correctly render the SET clause among multiple columns
        with the same name across tables.  This also changes the name used for
        the bound parameter in the SET clause to "<tablename>_<colname>" for
        the non-primary table only; as this parameter is typically specified
        using the :class:`.Column` object directly this should not have an
        impact on applications.   The fix takes effect for both
        :meth:`.Table.update` as well as :meth:`.Query.update` in the ORM.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, oracle
        :tickets: 2911

        It's been observed that the usage of a cx_Oracle "outputtypehandler"
        in Python 2.xx in order to coerce string values to Unicode is inordinately
        expensive; even though cx_Oracle is written in C, when you pass the
        Python ``unicode`` primitive to cursor.var() and associate with an output
        handler, the library counts every conversion as a Python function call
        with all the requisite overhead being recorded; this *despite* the fact
        when running in Python 3, all strings are also unconditionally coerced
        to unicode but it does *not* incur this overhead,
        meaning that cx_Oracle is failing to use performant techniques in Py2K.
        As SQLAlchemy cannot easily select for this style of type handler on a
        per-column basis, the handler was assembled unconditionally thereby
        adding the overhead to all string access.

        So this logic has been replaced with SQLAlchemy's own unicode
        conversion system, which now
        only takes effect in Py2K for columns that are requested as unicode.
        When C extensions are used, SQLAlchemy's system appears to be 2-3x faster than
        cx_Oracle's.  Additionally, SQLAlchemy's unicode conversion has been
        enhanced such that when the "conditional" converter is required
        (now needed for the Oracle backend), the check for "already unicode" is now
        performed in C and no longer introduces significant overhead.

        This change has two impacts on the cx_Oracle backend.  One is that
        string values in Py2K which aren't specifically requested with the
        Unicode type or convert_unicode=True will now come back as ``str``,
        not ``unicode`` - this behavior is similar to a backend such as
        MySQL.  Additionally, when unicode values are requested with the cx_Oracle
        backend, if the C extensions are *not* used, there is now an additional
        overhead of an isinstance() check per column.  This tradeoff has been
        made as it can be worked around and no longer places a performance burden
        on the likely majority of Oracle result columns that are non-unicode
        strings.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2908

        Fixed a bug involving the new flattened JOIN structures which
        are used with :func:`.joinedload()` (thereby causing a regression
        in joined eager loading) as well as :func:`.aliased`
        in conjunction with the ``flat=True`` flag and joined-table inheritance;
        basically multiple joins across a "parent JOIN sub" entity using different
        paths to get to a target class wouldn't form the correct ON conditions.
        An adjustment / simplification made in the mechanics of figuring
        out the "left side" of the join in the case of an aliased, joined-inh
        class repairs the issue.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql

        The MySQL CAST compilation now takes into account aspects of a string
        type such as "charset" and "collation".  While MySQL wants all character-
        based CAST calls to use the CHAR type, we now create a real CHAR
        object at CAST time and copy over all the parameters it has, so that
        an expression like ``cast(x, mysql.TEXT(charset='utf8'))`` will
        render ``CAST(t.col AS CHAR CHARACTER SET utf8)``.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 2906

        Added new "unicode returns" detection to the MySQL dialect and
        to the default dialect system overall, such that any dialect
        can add extra "tests" to the on-first-connect "does this DBAPI
        return unicode directly?" detection. In this case, we are
        adding a check specifically against the "utf8" encoding with
        an explicit "utf8_bin" collation type (after checking that
        this collation is available) to test for some buggy unicode
        behavior observed with MySQLdb version 1.2.3.  While MySQLdb
        has resolved this issue as of 1.2.4, the check here should
        guard against regressions.  The change also allows the "unicode"
        checks to log in the engine logs, which was not previously
        the case.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql, pool, engine
        :tickets: 2907

        :class:`.Connection` now associates a new
        :class:`.RootTransaction` or :class:`.TwoPhaseTransaction`
        with its immediate :class:`._ConnectionFairy` as a "reset handler"
        for the span of that transaction, which takes over the task
        of calling commit() or rollback() for the "reset on return" behavior
        of :class:`.Pool` if the transaction was not otherwise completed.
        This resolves the issue that a picky transaction
        like that of MySQL two-phase will be
        properly closed out when the connection is closed without an
        explicit rollback or commit (e.g. no longer raises "XAER_RMFAIL"
        in this case - note this only shows up in logging as the exception
        is not propagated within pool reset).
        This issue would arise e.g. when using an orm
        :class:`.Session` with ``twophase`` set, and then
        :meth:`.Session.close` is called without an explicit rollback or
        commit.   The change also has the effect that you will now see
        an explicit "ROLLBACK" in the logs when using a :class:`.Session`
        object in non-autocommit mode regardless of how that session was
        discarded.  Thanks to Jeff Dairiki and Laurence Rowe for isolating
        the issue here.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, pool, engine

        Added a new pool event :meth:`.PoolEvents.invalidate`.  Called when
        a DBAPI connection is to be marked as "invaldated" and discarded
        from the pool.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, pool

        The argument names for the :meth:`.PoolEvents.reset` event have been
        renamed to ``dbapi_connection`` and ``connection_record`` in order
        to maintain consistency with all the other pool events.  It is expected
        that any existing listeners for this relatively new and
        seldom-used event are using positional style to receive arguments in
        any case.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k, cextensions
        :pullreq: github:55

        Fixed an issue where the C extensions in Py3K are using the wrong API
        to specify the top-level module function, which breaks
        in Python 3.4b2.  Py3.4b2 changes PyMODINIT_FUNC to return
        "void" instead of "PyObject *", so we now make sure to use
        "PyMODINIT_FUNC" instead of "PyObject *" directly.  Pull request
        courtesy cgohlke.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, schema
        :pullreq: github:57

        Restored :class:`sqlalchemy.schema.SchemaVisitor` to the ``.schema``
        module.  Pullreq courtesy Sean Dague.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.1
    :released: January 5, 2014

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, events
        :tickets: 2905

        Fixed regression where using a ``functools.partial()`` with the event
        system would cause a recursion overflow due to usage of inspect.getargspec()
        on it in order to detect a legacy calling signature for certain events,
        and apparently there's no way to do this with a partial object.  Instead
        we skip the legacy check and assume the modern style; the check itself
        now only occurs for the SessionEvents.after_bulk_update and
        SessionEvents.after_bulk_delete events.  Those two events will require
        the new signature style if assigned to a "partial" event listener.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm, extensions

        A new, **experimental** extension :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.automap` is added.
        This extension expands upon the functionality of Declarative as well as
        the :class:`.DeferredReflection` class to produce a base class which
        automatically generates mapped classes *and relationships* based on
        table metadata.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, sql

        Conjunctions like :func:`.and_` and :func:`.or_` can now accept
        Python generators as a single argument, e.g.::

            and_(x == y for x, y in tuples)

        The logic here looks for a single argument ``*args`` where the first
        element is an instance of ``types.GeneratorType``.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, schema

        The :paramref:`.Table.extend_existing` and :paramref:`.Table.autoload_replace`
        parameters are now available on the :meth:`.MetaData.reflect`
        method.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, declarative

        Fixed an extremely unlikely memory issue where when using
        :class:`.DeferredReflection`
        to define classes pending for reflection, if some subset of those
        classes were discarded before the :meth:`.DeferredReflection.prepare`
        method were called to reflect and map the class, a strong reference
        to the class would remain held within the declarative internals.
        This internal collection of "classes to map" now uses weak
        references against the classes themselves.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :pullreq: bitbucket:9

        Fixed bug where using new :attr:`.Session.info` attribute would fail
        if the ``.info`` argument were only passed to the :class:`.sessionmaker`
        creation call but not to the object itself.  Courtesy Robin Schoonover.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2901

        Fixed regression where we don't check the given name against the
        correct string class when setting up a backref based on a name,
        therefore causing the error "too many values to unpack".  This was
        related to the Py3k conversion.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, declarative
        :tickets: 2900

        A quasi-regression where apparently in 0.8 you can set a class-level
        attribute on declarative to simply refer directly to an :class:`.InstrumentedAttribute`
        on a superclass or on the class itself, and it
        acts more or less like a synonym; in 0.9, this fails to set up enough
        bookkeeping to keep up with the more liberalized backref logic
        from :ticket:`2789`.  Even though this use case was never directly
        considered, it is now detected by declarative at the "setattr()" level
        as well as when setting up a subclass, and the mirrored/renamed attribute
        is now set up as a :func:`.synonym` instead.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2903

        Fixed regression where we apparently still create an implicit
        alias when saying query(B).join(B.cs), where "C" is a joined inh
        class; however, this implicit alias was created only considering
        the immediate left side, and not a longer chain of joins along different
        joined-inh subclasses of the same base.   As long as we're still
        implicitly aliasing in this case, the behavior is dialed back a bit
        so that it will alias the right side in a wider variety of cases.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.0
    :released: December 30, 2013

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, declarative
        :tickets: 2828

        Declarative does an extra check to detect if the same
        :class:`.Column` is mapped multiple times under different properties
        (which typically should be a :func:`.synonym` instead) or if two
        or more :class:`.Column` objects are given the same name, raising
        a warning if this condition is detected.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, firebird
        :tickets: 2898

        Changed the queries used by Firebird to list table and view names
        to query from the ``rdb$relations`` view instead of the
        ``rdb$relation_fields`` and ``rdb$view_relations`` views.
        Variants of both the old and new queries are mentioned on many
        FAQ and blogs, however the new queries are taken straight from
        the "Firebird FAQ" which appears to be the most official source
        of info.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 2893

        Improvements to the system by which SQL types generate within
        ``__repr__()``, particularly with regards to the MySQL integer/numeric/
        character types which feature a wide variety of keyword arguments.
        The ``__repr__()`` is important for use with Alembic autogenerate
        for when Python code is rendered in a migration script.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, postgresql
        :tickets: 2581
        :pullreq: github:50

        Support for Postgresql JSON has been added, using the new
        :class:`.JSON` type.   Huge thanks to Nathan Rice for
        implementing and testing this.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql

        The :func:`.cast` function, when given a plain literal value,
        will now apply the given type to the given literal value on the
        bind parameter side according to the type given to the cast,
        in the same manner as that of the :func:`.type_coerce` function.
        However unlike :func:`.type_coerce`, this only takes effect if a
        non-clauseelement value is passed to :func:`.cast`; an existing typed
        construct will retain its type.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, postgresql

        Now using psycopg2 UNICODEARRAY extension for handling unicode arrays
        with psycopg2 + normal "native unicode" mode, in the same way the
        UNICODE extension is used.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2883

        The :class:`.ForeignKey` class more aggressively checks the given
        column argument.   If not a string, it checks that the object is
        at least a :class:`.ColumnClause`, or an object that resolves to one,
        and that the ``.table`` attribute, if present, refers to a
        :class:`.TableClause` or subclass, and not something like an
        :class:`.Alias`.  Otherwise, a :class:`.ArgumentError` is raised.


    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm

        The :class:`.exc.StatementError` or DBAPI-related subclass
        now can accomodate additional information about the "reason" for
        the exception; the :class:`.Session` now adds some detail to it
        when the exception occurs within an autoflush.  This approach
        is taken as opposed to combining :class:`.FlushError` with
        a Python 3 style "chained exception" approach so as to maintain
        compatibility both with Py2K code as well as code that already
        catches ``IntegrityError`` or similar.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, postgresql

        Added support for Postgresql TSVECTOR via the
        :class:`.postgresql.TSVECTOR` type.  Pull request courtesy
        Noufal Ibrahim.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, engine
        :tickets: 2875

        The :func:`.engine_from_config` function has been improved so that
        we will be able to parse dialect-specific arguments from string
        configuration dictionaries.  Dialect classes can now provide their
        own list of parameter types and string-conversion routines.
        The feature is not yet used by the built-in dialects, however.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 2879

        The precedence rules for the :meth:`.ColumnOperators.collate` operator
        have been modified, such that the COLLATE operator is now of lower
        precedence than the comparison operators.  This has the effect that
        a COLLATE applied to a comparison will not render parenthesis
        around the comparison, which is not parsed by backends such as
        MSSQL.  The change is backwards incompatible for those setups that
        were working around the issue by applying :meth:`.Operators.collate`
        to an individual element of the comparison expression,
        rather than the comparison expression as a whole.

        The :class:`.DeferredReflection` class has been enhanced to provide
        automatic reflection support for the "secondary" table referred
        to by a :func:`.relationship`.   "secondary", when specified
        either as a string table name, or as a :class:`.Table` object with

        New improvements to the :func:`.text` construct, including
        more flexible ways to set up bound parameters and return types;
        in particular, a :func:`.text` can now be turned into a full
        FROM-object, embeddable in other statements as an alias or CTE
        using the new method :meth:`.TextClause.columns`.   The :func:`.text`
        construct can also render "inline" bound parameters when the construct

        Some refinements to the :class:`.AliasedClass` construct with regards
        to descriptors, like hybrids, synonyms, composites, user-defined
        descriptors, etc.  The attribute
        adaptation which goes on has been made more robust, such that if a descriptor
        returns another instrumented attribute, rather than a compound SQL
        expression element, the operation will still proceed.
        Addtionally, the "adapted" operator will retain its class; previously,
        a change in class from ``InstrumentedAttribute`` to ``QueryableAttribute``
        (a superclass) would interact with Python's operator system such that
        an expression like ``aliased(MyClass.x) > MyClass.x`` would reverse itself
        to read ``myclass.x < myclass_1.x``.   The adapted attribute will also
        refer to the new :class:`.AliasedClass` as its parent which was not
        always the case before.

        and :class:`.Float` types, which will ensure this many digits are taken
        from the native floating point value when it is converted to string.
        If not present, the type will make use of the value of ``.scale``, if
        the type supports this setting and it is non-None.  Otherwise the original
        default length of 10 is used.

        The ``viewonly`` flag on :func:`.relationship` will now prevent
        attribute history from being written on behalf of the target attribute.
        This has the effect of the object not being written to the
        Session.dirty list if it is mutated.  Previously, the object would
        be present in Session.dirty, but no change would take place on behalf
        of the modified attribute during flush.   The attribute still emits
        events such as backref events and user-defined events and will still
        receive mutations from backrefs.

        A :func:`.bindparam` construct with a "null" type (e.g. no type
        specified) is now copied when used in a typed expression, and the
        new copy is assigned the actual type of the compared column.  Previously,
        this logic would occur on the given :func:`.bindparam` in place.
        Additionally, a similar process now occurs for :func:`.bindparam` constructs
        passed to :meth:`.ValuesBase.values` for an :class:`.Insert` or
        :class:`.Update` construct, within the compilation phase of the

        be rendered as strings, typically within DDL constructs such as
        CHECK constraints and indexes (note that "literal bind" values
        become used by DDL as of :ticket:`2742`).  A new method
        :meth:`.TypeEngine.literal_processor` serves as the base, and
        :meth:`.TypeDecorator.process_literal_param` is added to allow wrapping
        of a native literal rendering method.

        objects within the structure including columns, constraints,
        foreign keys, etc.   As these dictionaries
        are copies, they are independent of the original dictionary.

        along with a warning.  This also helps with Alembic where
        the SET type doesn't render with quotes.

        The system of loader options has been entirely rearchitected to build
        upon a much more comprehensive base, the :class:`.Load` object.  This
        base allows any common loader option like :func:`.joinedload`,
        :func:`.defer`, etc. to be used in a "chained" style for the purpose
        of specifying options down a path, such as ``joinedload("foo").subqueryload("bar")``.
        The new system supersedes the usage of dot-separated path names,
        multiple attributes within options, and the usage of ``_all()`` options.

        The :func:`.composite` construct now maintains the return object
        when used in a column-oriented :class:`.Query`, rather than expanding
        out into individual columns.  This makes use of the new :class:`.Bundle`
        feature internally.  This behavior is backwards incompatible; to
        select from a composite column which will expand out, use
        ``MyClass.some_composite.clauses``.

        The group of columns are returned as a single tuple by default.  The
        behavior of :class:`.Bundle` can be overridden however to provide
        any sort of result processing to the returned row.  The behavior

        A rework to the way that "quoted" identifiers are handled, in that
        instead of relying upon various ``quote=True`` flags being passed around,
        these flags are converted into rich string objects with quoting information
        included at the point at which they are passed to common schema constructs
        like :class:`.Table`, :class:`.Column`, etc.   This solves the issue
        of various methods that don't correctly honor the "quote" flag such
        as :meth:`.Engine.has_table` and related methods.  The :class:`.quoted_name`
        object is a string subclass that can also be used explicitly if needed;
        the object will hold onto the quoting preferences passed and will
        also bypass the "name normalization" performed by dialects that
        standardize on uppercase symbols, such as Oracle, Firebird and DB2.
        The upshot is that the "uppercase" backends can now work with force-quoted
        names, such as lowercase-quoted names and new reserved words.

        to rely upon server generated version identifiers, using triggers
        or other database-provided versioning features, or via an optional programmatic
        value, by setting ``version_id_generator=False``.
        When using a server-generated version identfier, the ORM will use RETURNING when
        available to immediately
        load the new version value, else it will emit a second SELECT.

        The ``eager_defaults`` flag of :class:`.Mapper` will now allow the

        that support RETURNING.

        with the compilers usual "implicit returning" feature, which is used to
        efficiently fetch newly generated primary key values.  For supporting

        has focused on a large reduction in import cycles.   Additionally,
        the system of API functions in ``sqlalchemy.sql.expression`` and

        The mechanism by which attribute events pass along an
        :class:`.AttributeImpl` as an "initiator" token has been changed;
        the object is now an event-specific object called :class:`.attributes.Event`.
        Additionally, the attribute system no longer halts events based
        on a matching "initiator" token; this logic has been moved to be
        specific to ORM backref event handlers, which are the typical source
        of the re-propagation of an attribute event onto subsequent append/set/remove
        operations.  End user code which emulates the behavior of backrefs
        must now ensure that recursive event propagation schemes are halted,
        if the scheme does not use the backref handlers.   Using this new system,
        backref handlers can now peform a
        "two-hop" operation when an object is appended to a collection,
        associated with a new many-to-one, de-associated with the previous
        many-to-one, and then removed from a previous collection.   Before this
        change, the last step of removal from the previous collection would
        not occur.

        Added new method to the :func:`.insert` construct
        :meth:`.Insert.from_select`.  Given a list of columns and
        a selectable, renders ``INSERT INTO (table) (columns) SELECT ..``.
        While this feature is highlighted as part of 0.9 it is also
        backported to 0.8.3.

        * :meth:`.ConnectionEvents.set_engine_execution_options`

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 1765

        The resolution of :class:`.ForeignKey` objects to their
        target :class:`.Column` has been reworked to be as
        immediate as possible, based on the moment that the
        target :class:`.Column` is associated with the same
        :class:`.MetaData` as this :class:`.ForeignKey`, rather
        than waiting for the first time a join is constructed,
        or similar. This along with other improvements allows
        earlier detection of some foreign key configuration
        issues.  Also included here is a rework of the
        type-propagation system, so that
        it should be reliable now to set the type as ``None``
        on any :class:`.Column` that refers to another via
        :class:`.ForeignKey` - the type will be copied from the
        target column as soon as that other column is associated,
        and now works for composite foreign keys as well.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, sql
        :tickets: 2744, 2734

        Provided a new attribute for :class:`.TypeDecorator`
        called :attr:`.TypeDecorator.coerce_to_is_types`,
        to make it easier to control how comparisons using
        ``==`` or ``!=`` to ``None`` and boolean types goes
        about producing an ``IS`` expression, or a plain
        equality expression with a bound parameter.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, pool
        :tickets: 2752

        Added pool logging for "rollback-on-return" and the less used
        "commit-on-return".  This is enabled with the rest of pool
        "debug" logging.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, associationproxy
        :tickets: 2751

        Added additional criterion to the ==, != comparators, used with
        scalar values, for comparisons to None to also take into account
        the association record itself being non-present, in addition to the
        existing test for the scalar endpoint on the association record
        being NULL.  Previously, comparing ``Cls.scalar == None`` would return
        records for which ``Cls.associated`` were present and
        ``Cls.associated.scalar`` is None, but not rows for which
        ``Cls.associated`` is non-present.  More significantly, the
        inverse operation ``Cls.scalar != None`` *would* return ``Cls``
        rows for which ``Cls.associated`` was non-present.

        The case for ``Cls.scalar != 'somevalue'`` is also modified
        to act more like a direct SQL comparison; only rows for
        which ``Cls.associated`` is present and ``Associated.scalar``
        is non-NULL and not equal to ``'somevalue'`` are returned.
        Previously, this would be a simple ``NOT EXISTS``.

        Also added a special use case where you
        can call ``Cls.scalar.has()`` with no arguments,
        when ``Cls.scalar`` is a column-based value - this returns whether or
        not ``Cls.associated`` has any rows present, regardless of whether
        or not ``Cls.associated.scalar`` is NULL or not.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm
        :tickets: 2587

        A major change regarding how the ORM constructs joins where
        the right side is itself a join or left outer join.   The ORM
        is now configured to allow simple nesting of joins of
        the form ``a JOIN (b JOIN c ON b.id=c.id) ON a.id=b.id``,
        rather than forcing the right side into a ``SELECT`` subquery.
        This should allow significant performance improvements on most
        backends, most particularly MySQL.   The one database backend
        that has for many years held back this change, SQLite, is now addressed by
        moving the production of the ``SELECT`` subquery from the
        ORM to the SQL compiler; so that a right-nested join on SQLite will still
        ultimately render with a ``SELECT``, while all other backends
        are no longer impacted by this workaround.

        As part of this change, a new argument ``flat=True`` has been added
        to the :func:`.orm.aliased`, :meth:`.Join.alias`, and
        :func:`.orm.with_polymorphic` functions, which allows an "alias" of a
        JOIN to be produced which applies an anonymous alias to each component
        table within the join, rather than producing a subquery.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 2369

        Fixed an obscure bug where the wrong results would be
        fetched when joining/joinedloading across a many-to-many
        relationship to a single-table-inheriting
        subclass with a specific discriminator value, due to "secondary"
        rows that would come back.  The "secondary" and right-side
        tables are now inner joined inside of parenthesis for all
        ORM joins on many-to-many relationships so that the left->right
        join can accurately filtered.  This change was made possible
        by finally addressing the issue with right-nested joins
        outlined in :ticket:`2587`.

        :tickets: 1068

        A :func:`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.label` construct will now render as its name alone
        in an ``ORDER BY`` clause, if that label is also referred to
        in the columns clause of the select, instead of rewriting the
        full expression.  This gives the database a better chance to
        optimize the evaulation of the same expression in two different
        contexts.

        The "auto-aliasing" behavior of the :meth:`.Query.select_from`
        method has been turned off.  The specific behavior is now
        availble via a new method :meth:`.Query.select_entity_from`.
        The auto-aliasing behavior here was never well documented and
        is generally not what's desired, as :meth:`.Query.select_from`
        has become more oriented towards controlling how a JOIN is
        rendered.  :meth:`.Query.select_entity_from` will also be made
        available in 0.8 so that applications which rely on the auto-aliasing
        can shift their applications to use this method.
